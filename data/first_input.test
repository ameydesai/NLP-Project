	
Today, in order to find a correct solution to the Middle East issue, it is important to frustrate Israel's territorial ambition and create conditions for Palestine to create an independent state of its own. Apart from this, we cannot talk about the settlement of the Middle East issue. 
	
	
 The great leader [suryong] Comrade Kim Il-song taught: 
	
	
 "Imperialism is the source of war and the disturber of peace." 
	
	
 It is an urgent matter for Israel to withdraw completely from the occupied land of Palestine. 
	
	
 Israel makes itself appear to be withdrawing its troops from some of the occupied Palestinian autonomous areas. On 17 November, Israeli troops pulled out of Tulkarm, a West Bank area of the Jordan River. 
	
	
 However, this is no reason to be optimistic about the situation. 
	
	
 Toward the end of October, Israel declared that it would withdraw from some of the Palestinian autonomous areas where the situation was "relatively calm" and pretended to be abiding by the decision. However, it stopped withdrawing its troops halfway through under the pretext of "unstable situation" and occupied them again. There is no way of knowing whether or not Israel will halt the withdrawal of its troops again under any pretext as it did before. 
	
	
 On 18 November, the following day Israel began withdrawing its troops from Tulkarm, Israeli troops deliberately gunned down two Palestinians in the Palestinian autonomous areas as if they were quarries. On 20 November, the Israeli army bulldozed dwelling houses in the Palestinian autonomous area and even committed such an atrocious act as wounding Palestinians without hesitation. As a result, the situation has become tense again. 
	
	
 It was in fact due to strong international pressure that Israel began withdrawing its troops from the Palestinian autonomous area. 
	
	
 In September last year Israeli Prime Minister Sharon, the then leader of the opposition party, visited a holy place in Kuds [Jerusalem], throwing Israel and Palestine into a fierce fight. Sharon's remarks and behavior that were insulting to the Palestinians infuriated Palestine. The desperate fight even took tolls of women and children. 
	
	
 The clash between Israel and Palestine briefly appeared to be abating in the wake of the large-scale attack incident [taesupkyok sakon] against the United States. However, it has become fierce again after Israeli minister of tourism was assassinated. Taking advantage of this, Israel occupied six cities located in the Palestinian autonomous areas by the use of force. 
	
	
 The United Nations and many countries around the world began paying attention again to the situation in the Middle East that is becoming more complicated. International pressure is on Israel again. 
	
	
 Caving in to the international pressure, the United States pretended to support the creation of an independent Palestinian state. The United States, which is currently waging a war in Afghanistan, tried to shore up support from Arab states and Islamic world through a crafty ruse. Seeing through the US scheme, Israel refused to continue the troop withdrawal from the Palestinian autonomous area. 
	
	
 Israel has never abandoned its aggressive ambitions. 
	
	
 Convinced that the United States can never abandon it completely, Israel is dragging its feet on the withdrawal of troops citing a variety of excuses. 
	
	
 Israel is adamantly against the creation of a completely independent Palestinian state. Israel's scheme is to make Palestine a vassal state and bring it under its control. This is why Israel agreed to discuss the issue of granting independence to Palestine on conditions that Palestine claim only a small piece of territory and waive its right to raise [organize] a regular army. 
	
	
 As such, Israel's territorial ambition is persistent and clever. 
	
	
 The US administration is about to call on Israel to support the creation of a Palestinian state with East Kuds as its capital. 
	
	
 Commenting on this, many Arab states and international opinion emphatically said that it is nothing more than a political stratagem to win support for its war in Afghanistan and to further expand the sphere of its domination in the Middle East. 
	
	
 The United States, which has been in the van of invading other countries, is about to put pressure on Israel, not because it is now more sympathetic to Palestine or finds Palestine more tolerable than before, but because of its own national interests. 
	
	
 It is quite obvious that Israel will employ a crafty trick in the future to realize its burning territorial ambition. It is also obvious that the aggressive US policy toward the Middle East will remain unchanged. 
	
	
 The prospect for the settlement of the Middle East issue is still bleak due to those who stand in the way of the settlement. 
	
	
	


	
A 26 November 2001 article in Zhongguo Renkou Bao reported that in April 2001, the State Family Planning Commission initiated its transprovincial floating population investigation by surveying the marriage, birth, and birth control situations of 27,879 migrant women between the ages of 15 and 49. 
	
	
 Of the women surveyed, 87.2 percent (24,310) were married, higher than the national average of 82.3 percent (according to the 1997 National Population and Reproductive Health Survey). The average number of 15- to 19-year-old migrant women who are married with children is higher than the national average. The average for migrant women in the other age groups is lower than the national average. 
	
	
 Only about 30 percent of the migrant women who are married with two or more children have obtained official migrant population marriage documentation as required by the Procedures For Managing Floating Population Family Planning. This is less than the registration rate of migrant women with no or one child. 
	
	
 The percentage of married migrant women using contraceptives is 90.6 percent, higher than the national average of 83.4 percent. Moreover, those with children mostly use long-term contraceptive methods. The rate of using long-term contraceptive methods is higher among women with one son than women with one daughter. Those with two children mostly undergo sterilization. However, the use of sterilization among "households with two daughters" is significantly less than among households with at least one son.

JOHANNESBURG March 16 Sapa MBEKI TO MEET WITH MUGABE AND TSVANGIRAI IN HARARE ON MONDAY 
	
	
 (CORRECTS TITLE OF AUSTRALIAN PM, UPDATES WITH ZUMA ATTENDING INAUGURATION) President Thabo Mbeki would fly to Harare on Monday to meet Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and later with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, presidential spokesman Bheki Khumalo told Sapa on Saturday. 
	
	
 Khumalo said Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo would also attend the talks, which would culminate on Tuesday when the two met Australian Prime Minister John Howard in London. Mugabe was to be inaugurated again as Zimbabwean president on Sunday following his controversial re-election last weekend. He was first elected Prime Minister in 1980 and has effectively ruled the country ever since. 
	
	
 Mbeki, Obasanjo and Howard have been mandated by the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Australia to decide what action should be taken on the situation in Zimbabwe. Their decision would be based on the Commonwealth observer team's report on the legitimacy of the election as well as those prepared by the Southern African Development Community, the Organisation of African Unity and the SA Observer Mission. The Commonwealth team earlier this week said that "the conditions in Zimbabwe did not adequately allow the free and fair expression of will by the electorate". 
	
	
 The SADC on Saturday endorsed the vote, despite its Parliamentary Forum, which judging that the March 9-11 election "did not conform with the norms and standards of the SADC Parliamentary Forum," signed on to by Zimbabwe. The team from the organisation's Council of Ministers, on the other hand, considered the vote a "true reflection" of the people's will. 
	
	
 The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) also backed Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's re-election, with its observer team describing the poll as "transparent, credible, free and fair". South Africa's observer mission also endorsed the vote, saying in an interim report that "(o)verall ... the authorities charged with conducting the elections discharged their work satisfactorily." The team acknowledged that the election campaign had been characterised by "polarisation, tension and incidents of violence and intimidation." In terms of the Commonwealth's mandate, action against Zimbabwe could range from collective disapproval to suspension. 
	
	
 Mbeki was, however, already on the record as saying that the Commonwealth also had other issues to consider. CHOGM had also decided to look at ways of helping Zimbabwe with land reform and food aid. State-sanctioned land invasions, several times declared illegal by Zimbabwe's courts, as well as a drought have disrupted Zimbabwe's food production and famine is already looming in much of the country. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said Mbeki's deputy, Jacob Zuma would represent the country at the controversially re-elected President Robert Mugabe's latest inauguration, scheduled for Sunday in Harare. No reason was provided why Mbeki could not attend. Reports from Lagos indicated that Obasanjo would also not attend. 
	
	
 Several other heads of state had by Saturday indicated they would attend, including Tanzania's Benjamin Nkapa and Malawi's Bakili Muluzi, currently also the SADC's president. Mamoepa said the key points on the agenda now was Zimbabwe's economic recovery and social stability "within the context of national unity."

Foreign Minister Celso Lafer transmitted a warning to United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, with whom he spent 30 minutes yesterday, from the Brazilian Government: without help from the US, Argentina could enter a state of social rebellion and open a new front of geopolitical instability in South America. Powell's reaction, according to a Planalto source, was one of "interest and attention". No more than that. The Brazilian Government's perception of Argentina's future is pessimistic. "Their economic agenda alone is overwhelming," the source commented. It requires the creation of a Central Bank capable of administering a floating exchange rate system and a regime of inflation goals; the establishment of a safety network for the debilitated financial system; the restructuring of the tax policy, and the elaboration of a law that ensures fiscal discipline. Without US help, via the IMF, the country will not be able to attain the most basic economic, social and political stability, and could contaminate the subcontinent, Lafer warned. 
	
	
 [passage omitted] 
	
	
 "La plata" or social rebellion 
	
	
 Foreign Minister Celso Lafer carried a dramatic warning from President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to the US Government. In his conversation with Secretary of State Colin Powell, the Brazilian Foreign Minister stated clearly that to leave Argentina to its own fate, as seems to be the George Bush administration's choice, is to pave the way for social rebellion there, which will contaminate other countries on the continent and create another area of political instability on the planet. 
	
	
 The Argentina theme was also covered in Lafer's talks yesterday with Commerce Secretary Don Evans and with US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick. According to a Planalto Palace source, the reaction from Powell as well as from Evans and Zoellick was of "interest and attention". Nothing more. 
	
	
 Translating roughly, what Minister Lafer tried to tell the Americans is that the financial cost of an international rescue of Argentina, now, led by the IMF and other multilateral credit agencies, will be lower than the cost of fighting, later on, chaos in its social, political, and - why not? - military forms on the continent. 
	
	
 South America is already living with complex problems in Venezuela and, above all, in Colombia, where President Andres Pastrana is unable to combat the guerrilla activities of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] and failed in the recent attempt to negotiate an agreement with its militants. For Brazilian diplomacy, Pastrana lost time and credibility on a failed bet: the negotiations with FARC, letting them control territory the size of Switzerland in the heart of the continent. 
	
	
 To add a country like Argentina to this list of problems is to allow the growth of a dangerous focus of social dissatisfaction, which is tending to express itself outside of any institutional control. Argentine society is divorcing itself from political parties and national institutions, and it is in such an environment that radical responses germinate, such as authoritarian regimes and the formation of guerrilla groups. 
	
	
 The ill effects of the Argentine crisis can contaminate the nearest countries first, like Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia. And there is no guarantee that a political destabilization of the region would bypass even Chile, where memories of the military dictatorship are still very strong. One cannot ignore the fact that, only 20 years ago, all these countries - including Brazil and Peru - were ruled by generals. 
	
	
 There is an entire. political and diplomatic argument in the conversations with representatives of the Bush government that transcends the economic-financial discussions, to which the subject was restricted, and which encompasses the very survival of democracy in South America. It is a new approach, which tries to sensitize US authorities through the use of geopolitical arguments. Not to take into account the impact of destabilization in South America in a world already complicated by the Middle East, India versus Pakistan, Afghanistan, and badly-resolved problems in Eastern Europe, "is not to have a strategic vision," according to the assessment that is being made in Planalto Palace and which was clearly emphasized during Lafer's meetings with Powell, Zoellick and Evans. 
	
	
 The Brazilian Government's perception of Argentina's future is pessimistic. There is a stress factor in the content and volume of the needs of that country, which on its own will not be able to take the steps absolutely necessary for its reconstruction. This is the understanding of sources very close to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and it is also guiding the analyses of the economic department. 
	
	
 What is underway in the neighboring country, according to information gathered by the Brazilian Government, is the establishment of a Central Bank - which 10 years ago abdicated from the traditional functions of currency and credit manager - that is capable of working with a floating exchange rate system and a regime of inflation goals, like Brazil's Central Bank; a safety network for the financial system whose health is already extremely undermined; the restructuring of the tax policy so that the tax collection machine can create conditions for the government to draw up a budget without so many uncertainties; and a fiscal responsibility law that imposes some discipline on the relationship between central government and the provinces. 
	
	
 "This is the minimum that has to be done. Their economic agenda alone is overwhelming," comments one high-ranking member of the Brazilian Government. Alone, and under the command of a president who managed to create a strong political coalition explained only by his own survival instinct, Argentines will be unable to attain the most basic economic, social and political stability. How does this affect Brazil? To answer a question of this nature, the Brazilian Foreign Minister would surely resort to Ortega y Gasset: "I am I and my circumstances. If I do not save them, I do not save myself."

Tomorrow the government will announce a comprehensive economic and social plan based on the complete elimination of the dollar as a monetary standard through the conversion of deposits and loans into pesos. 
	
	
 For those owing less than $100,000, the conversion will be done at the rate of one to one. For those who owe between $100,000 and $300,000, the conversion rate will be 1.2 to 1, with the government making up the difference between this rate and that of the official dollar. It will help out the banks, as El Cronista reported, by giving them a bond or certificate against future revenues from the tax on crude oil exports (5 billion) and with part of the assistance that the IMF will reportedly provide (4 billion). Debts of more than $300,000 will continue to be converted at 1.4 to 1. 
	
	
 Barring last minute changes, no announcement is expected about allowing the peso to float freely, as the IMF would like, or about changes in the timetable for easing bank withdrawal restrictions. Under these restrictions, which were established by Domingo Cavallo and tightened by his successor, Jorge Remes Lenicov, the country's savers are barred from accessing more than 65 billion (pesos and mainly dollars) that they have on deposit. 
	
	
 This constraint, combined with the difficulties of even withdrawing money for daily use from salary direct-deposit accounts, has heightened social unrest, as people have staged marches, banging on pots and pans, and other demonstrations to protest the prevailing economic situation. 
	
	
 Some analysts feel that the fledgling Duhalde administration is making a mistake by ending convertibility without first resolving the problems that will arise from this decision, which was a foregone conclusion here in Argentina and the rest of the world. What is more, the IMF tried to convince Cavallo to abandon the one-to-one peg in an orderly fashion. 
	
	
 The fact that the former minister and President Fernando de la Rua, who later stepped down, were opposed to such a move drove the IMF even further away from lending any support. Its last show of support was the $8 billion in aid to support the "zero deficit" tactic. 
	
	
 Such budgetary discipline turned out to be impossible, thus shattering the rigid convertibility system and putting entire sectors of the economy out of commission. Lack of confidence led to massive withdrawals of savings into safer places. 
	
	
 The outflows forced some banks to ask the government to set limits. Cavallo could think of nothing better than the curbs on withdrawals. According to former Minister Roque Fernandez, it was "the worst mistake in the history of the Argentine economy," while influential businessman Arnaldo Musich (FIEL [Latin American Economic Research Foundation]-Techint) considered it an "inexcusable" mistake. 
	
	
 Burdensome Legacy 
	
	
 The last of the provisional governments that took over from the abbreviated De la Rua administration decided quickly to end the currency board system. But not until tomorrow, one month after taking office, will it announce a comprehensive plan to overcome the worst crisis in the country's history. 
	
	
 Duhalde will confirm that $2 billion will be made available immediately to mitigate the social disaster. This money was approved by the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. 
	
	
 Accompanied by Remes, he will talk tomorrow about what the assistance will be used for: to fulfill the promise to create a million jobs, to provide basic health care, and to undertake small infrastructure projects. The president will also mention imminent political reform, which he will call on Congress to enact. 
	
	
 The rest of his remarks will be solely about the economy, about which millions of Argentines have been obsessed for some years now. Mortgage loans, the debts of small and mid-sized companies, and automotive loans under $100,000 will be paid back in the identical amount of pesos. The same will go for secured loans under $300,000 and personal loans of up to $10,000. 
	
	
 Debts over these amounts will have to be repaid at 1.4 to 1, although the government will defray 20 cents on the dollar so that debtors will actually pay 1.2 pesos. 
	
	
 The banking restrictions will, for the time being, remain unchanged, but the tacit assumption is that the timetable for easing them will be speeded up "as soon as conditions permit." It has been confirmed that there will be "coupons" for savers who want to buy things, with their frozen funds as collateral. 
	
	
 The president will also break down the budget for the press and promise to issue currency in a controlled manner (not to exceed 3.5 billion pesos) and to undertake the difficult task of reversing the sudden decline in wealth (4.9 percent) without pushing inflation beyond 15 percent. 
	
	
 The dollar will be allowed to float as soon as possible, as the government has promised the IMF. Everything depends on the anticipated aid of between $15 billion and $20 billion, which is what has been requested of Washington. 
	
	
 Adjustment Index Will Be New Variable 
	
	
 One of the points on which the Duhalde administration's economic plan will be based is a monetary benchmark that will govern the issuance of pesos and the refunding of deposits in dollars that have been frozen in accounts. 
	
	
 To this end, Jorge Remes Lenicov's economic team has developed an index or formula including such parameters as projected annual inflation rates, the government's budget, the exchange rate of the dollar, and issuance of money by the Central Bank. 
	
	
 This system, which will serve as a financial tool for redrafting most of the contracts involving economic activity in the new, post-convertibility era, is similar to the "Celic" index that Brazil uses or the "Unidad de Fomento" that Chile used until August 2001. 
	
	
 The monetary benchmark that Brazil employs and that Chile used to is the most common one in today's world and is based on an inflation target. On the basis of this target a rule is developed to determine the interest rate needed to hit the target for price rises. The amount of money issued thus winds up being a function of these variables, not a target in itself, so that monetary policy can be used as a tool for promoting economic recovery. 
	
	
 Until August of last year Chile had an incremental adjustment mechanism that included an exchange rate band with a ceiling and floor. Monetary adjustments were based on what was called the "unidad de fomento," an indexing system that included various price indices and adjusted contracts in accordance with actual changes. 
	
	
 Brazil started using an inflation target once its 1999 devaluation stabilized the real and achieved low inflation. 
	
	
 The government explained that it theoretically saw tools like the "unidad de fomento" as a way of adjusting the deposits of savers that will remain subject to restrictions until at least next year. The index will persumably not be applied for another two or three months, and it has not been ruled out that it may include loans already converted into pesos. 
	
	
 Renes is working alongside a group of technicians from the IMF, World Bank, US Treasury Department, and Central Bank of Brazil, whose services were also used during the crises in Mexico and Indonesia. 
	
	
 [Buenos Aires Ambito Financiero in Spanish on 1 February adds the following: "The following are the main measures that will be announced tomorrow: 
	
	
 "'Dirty' float for the dollar: The decision has been made to abolish the official exchange rate (1.4 pesos to the dollar) and to move towards a single, floating rate. The Central Bank will intervene in the market, but only to prevent sudden swings. Intermediate solutions have been completely ruled out, such as periodic adjustments of the exchange rate (a crawling peg) or a band, which would oblige the Central Bank to intervene by selling dollars to defend a given value of the peso. The government wanted to wait until it had sealed an accord with the IMF before going to a float. But since the negotiations will take several weeks, as Remes will not be flying to Washington until 14 February, the idea is to move ahead before receiving international aid. Another possibility is to have released at least the $2.6 billion that has been pending disbursement since December in order to bolster reserves before the peso is allowed to float. 
	
	
 "Total release of salary direct-deposit accounts: All employees will soon be able to access their entire salary by making cash withdrawals from savings accounts. This will completely eliminate the ceiling of 1,500 pesos per month that had been set in the January version of the banking restrictions. This measure will benefit only the 4 percent of workers who earn more than that amount, which until now was subject to the restrictions. The danger, which the economic team is aware of, is that any additional money withdrawn will go straight into purchases of dollars since this could represent the percentage of income that an individual is able to save. The measure is designed to send a signal so that people gradually regain confidence. Raising the withdrawal ceiling in the case of regular savings accounts to 1,500 pesos a month was under consideration yesterday, but for now the limit of 1,200 a month will continue to apply, with the possibility of gradual increases in the near future. 
	
	
 "Deposits to be converted into pesos at 1.4 to 1: Time deposits in dollars will be converted into pesos at the official rate. Once they have been converted, the refund timetable for dollar deposits will initially be maintained. In other words, refunds will not begin until January 2003. If an agreement is reached with the IMF and economic conditions improve, the timetable will likely be moved forward so that people can get cash. The possibility of keeping a portion of a time deposit in dollars, which President Duhalde has requested, has not been altogether ruled out, but there are legal problems with implementing it. In the case of time deposits in pesos, the refund timetable is being maintained; it provides for withdrawals in cash as of March. 
	
	
 "Installment checks for time deposits: The money subject to a refund timetable may be used for purchases, but with restrictions. It cannot be credited to demand deposit accounts. Therefore, it can be used only to purchase items such as cars and apartments. The 12, 18, or 24 installments into which time deposits will be divided, depending on their amount, may be endorsed. Transfer of the time deposit will be authorized only in the case of a purchase. But the account holder will not be able to move it from one bank to another. The big drawback to this system is that hardly anyone will be willing to sell real estate for peso-denominated installment checks that can be cashed sometime in the future. They can be used, though, for smaller transactions or to pay for part of a purchase. 
	
	
 "Issuance of bonds indexed according to the value of the dollar: The Central Bank will soon start issuing bonds in pesos to offer the public another alternative to purchasing dollars. The idea is to issue very short-term bills (30 days, for now) that will be indexed to any ongoing depreciation. An arrangement with an attractive implicit interest rate could also be devised. It will not be easy, of course, to drum up demand with the country in full-fledged default. 
	
	
 "No withholding on oil exports: In conclusion, the government has decided to reverse itself on the 20 percent tax that it was planning to levy on these exports. 'We would not have raised all that much money and would have been sending a very bad signal overseas by discriminating between sectors,' acknowledged a senior source in the Economy Ministry. In any event, the oil industry may be asked for an advance on taxes due, as had been under consideration a couple of weeks ago. If any withholding arrangement is implemented, it will apply to all exports, not just some. 
	
	
 "Bonds in dollars to compensate banks: The banks will receive long-term government bonds in dollars as compensation for the losses that will arise from conversion into pesos on their balance sheets. Estimates are that under the arrangement that has been devised the red ink will total more than 12 billion pesos or some $6 billion. The banks have also agreed with this option. They wold rather hold a financial claim on the government than place the entire burden on their debtors, who would be forced to declare bankruptcy if they got no relief. 
	
	
 "Phase 1 of the swap remains in dollars: Banks, Pension and Retirement Fund Management Companies, and insurance companies exerted strong pressure to prevent all accounts from being converted into pesos at 1.4 to 1. They managed to keep their bonds in foreign currency and are supposed to start collecting interest this April. It is likely, however, that before that the government will move ahead with a comprehensive debt rescheduling, including international and local investors who were involved in the first phase of the swap."] 
	
	
	


	
Hamburg -- Some 200 German Border Guard officers working in cooperation with the Hamburg prosecutors' office on Wednesday cracked a ring of Afghan smugglers who have been operating throughout Europe. 
	
	
 Officials say that the smuggling ring had been illegally bringing fellow nationals into Germany via Austria since at least October 2001. Many of the refugees then travelled by rail from Hamburg to Britain via Brussels. Others took trains, vans and cars onto ferries destined for Scandinavia. The Afghans paid gang members up to 9,000 euros ($7,900) to make the trip. 
	
	
 The border guard officers searched a total of 16 apartments, stores and offices downtown and in Hamburg's Altona, Billstedt, Schnelsen, and Harburg districts, detaining 14 suspects. An arrest warrant for the suspected leader of the gang, an Afghan, was also served. Police seized 33,9000 euros -- believed to be earnings from smuggling operations -- in the apartment of the 35-year-old suspected ringleader. 
	
	
 Two men who were working with him, an Afghan and a Pakistani, were arrested as well. Eleven others were taken into custody, seven of whom were also members of the smuggling ring. The remaining four turned out to be Afghan refugees. A further four suspects were arrested in a similar operation in Frankfurt. 
	
	
 Police interrogators were told the refugees had been "parked" and were working illegally in northern Germany until they could be moved to other locations. 
	
	
 Sites in the towns of Ratzeburg and Uelzen were also searched in connection with the raid, said Wieland Mozdzynski, director of the Hamburg office of the border guard. 
	
	
 Mr. Mozdzynski said that during the operation, which stretched as far as the state of Bavaria and Austria, police had uncovered an "international network of groups, each with specific tasks." He added that the groups worked independently, but exploited existing contacts regularly. According to a police spokesman, more than 500 officers took part in the joint operation. 
	
	
 Another officer said the loose structure of the smuggling ring made the investigation more difficult. He said that the bust was nevertheless a significant and successful strike against gangs and businesses engaged in human smuggling.

 Baykonur, 15 March: Preparations on the Progress M-1 N257 transport spacecraft, which is scheduled to be launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on 21 March, are nearing completion at the Baykonur space vehicle launching site [in Kazakhstan]. Specialists at the space vehicle launching site told an Interfax-Kazakhstan news agency correspondent that Progress had been filled with rocket fuel components and compressed gases and it had been taken to an installing and testing facility of the Energiya [Energy] Rocket Space Corporation for the final operations to be carried out. The general assembly of the Soyuz-U booster-rocket (BR), which is to boost Progress M-1, is scheduled for 18 March. After the BR has been assembled, the state commission will take a decision to take the rocket to the launching site. A total of six space launches from Baykonur, including four cargo launches, scheduled within the ISS programme this year.	


	
New York -- The warlike tone of the State of the Union speech delivered by George Bush Tuesday evening has prompted responses as critical abroad as they are enthusiastic in the United States. Be that as it may, the aim pursued by the White House seems to have been achieved. This is to re-mobilize the country behind the war on terrorism and to prevent Americans, by returning to a more normal life, from concerning themselves chiefly with the daily repercussions of the Enron affair and rising unemployment. 
	
	
 In his fellow countrymen's eyes, the test constituted by 11 September has revealed George Bush's talents as a war leader. He is clearly more comfortable in this role than he is in he management of routine matters. His force of conviction when he preaches the struggle of good against evil largely explains his exceptional popularity ratings (83 percent of favorable opinions, according to the latest ABC and Washington Post surveys.) So on Tuesday evening George Bush tried to reproduce the tone of his 20 September speech in order to galvanize the country. "The United States will not allow the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the most destructive weapons. Whatever the cost of our country's defense, we will pay it. The evil is real, and it must be combated... even in the midst of tragedy, specially in the midst of tragedy, God is there..." 
	
	
 The unanimous opinion of the media is that he was successful in this. His speech was "brilliant, full of strength and eloquence. The pursuit of the war on terrorism has given Americans a new illustration of his character and his confidence in the country's leadership," the New York Times said. According to the Washington Post , "the President's intensity was equal to the need to pursue the war." Television commentaries were even more full of praise. "Solid and often eloquent remarks," CBS' Ran Rather said. CNN's Bill Bennett called it "a speech of moral strength." According to Fox's Juan Williams, "the words came straight from the heart." 
	
	
 The condemnation of the "axis of evil" comprising Iran, Iraq, and North Korea was applauded by Republican and Democrat hawks, and barely challenged by a few foreign relations experts. George Bush has succeeded not only in returning the war to the front pages of the newspapers, ousting the Enron affair and the budget deficit, but also in forcing the Democratic opposition to unite against the enemy. Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, and Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader in the Senate, have attempted the impossible feat of "setting partisan attitudes aside and supporting our President 100 percent in the war on terrorism," while at the same time trying to criticize economic and social policy. 
	
	
 As for responses abroad, in order to make them somewhat less sharp, the administration has introduced some qualifications. This, among other things, by specifying that no military operations are planned against any of the three countries cited. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer even added that the expression "axis of evil" was not used in an allusion to the notorious Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis. 
	
	
 However, George Bush is not about to change his rhetoric. "In the antiterrorist struggle, as far as I am concerned there is black and white, and no shades of gray," he said Thursday 31 January during an election campaign visit to Atlanta, Georgia, and to Daytona beach, Florida. 
	
	
 The President said he was confident about the US allies' support against countries trying to acquire mass destruction weapons. "The rest of the world needs to be with us, because such weapons can be targeted on them as well as on us." He again urged these countries to "clean their own homes." "If you are one of the countries that develops mass destruction weapons, and you are willing to ally with a terrorist group, or you currently support terrorism, or if you do not sincerely share the values precious to us, then you too will be under surveillance," he said. 
	
	
	


	
Cuito, 25 Jan (Angop)- A road convoy which came in from Benguela Province carrying 1,500 metric tons of assorted goods arrived in the city of Cuito, the capital of Bie Province, on Tuesday [22 Jan]. The aim of this aid is to reduce the shortages faced by local population. 
	
	
 According to convoy chief Eusebio da Silva Ferreira, the convoy included 35 trucks, and it ferried 720 metric tons of corn, 623 metric tons of peas, and 157 metric tons of beans. He added that the above mentioned products will help offset the difficult social conditions of more than 460,000 people in need in the province. 
	
	
 These aid goods have arrived at a time when the World Food Program, WFP is cutting down on air transportation of aid to Bie Province from 3,500 metric tons to 2,000 metric tons. This is because of the high costs involved, and the poor conditions of the local landing strip. Because of these problems, the WFP has not been able to provide all the necessary assistance to people in need, who are estimated to total more than 460,000. 
	
	
	


	
These days, when everything seems to be collapsing in the Middle East, both the Palestinians' chances of finally having a state in which their people would be sovereign, and the Israelis' chances of integrating themselves into a region where -- need we be reminded? -- the Arabs are in the overwhelming majority, we believe it our duty to voice a few basic truths. 
	
	
 One of us is a Palestinian patriot (and not a nationalist). The other has no other homeland than France, which does not, however, lead him to deny his heritage from ancient Israel (which contains, like all heritages, the best and the worst) nor to be indifferent to the destiny of those millions of Jews who have something in common with him. 
	
	
 We are both historians. 
	
	
 However, we will not look back at the entire century that has just passed. There was a quarrel concerning Zionism. Those involved in it had no shortage of arguments, whether Arab, Jewish, or simply clear-headed. Zionism established itself in a sensitive region of the world at a time when nothing seemed more "normal" than to settle in someone else's territory. 
	
	
 The United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand were all created at the conclusion of a colonial process. 
	
	
 No one today challenges their existence despite the crises arising from this process and which were cited by an Aboriginal athlete at the Olympic Games in Sydney. 
	
	
 Likewise, the more recent creation of Israel was accompanied, under the indifferent gaze of the Western and Soviet world, by the forced exodus of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Today, these refugees and their descendants do not call into question the existence of the state of Israel as long as the injustice suffered is recognized and the implementation of their rights is negotiated fairly. 
	
	
 Let us content ourselves with reiterating the evidence: Since June 1967, the West Bank and Gaza have been occupied and dominated territories, crushed politically, socially, economically. Despite this, the Palestinian resistance has formally recognized the existence of Israel and begun a peace process in Oslo, while the state of Israel has recognized the Palestinians represented by the PLO and its leader Yasser Arafat. 
	
	
 This process has not achieved its goal. 
	
	
 On the Palestinian side, feeding on the growing frustration of the occupied population, a wing has broken off, conducting a policy of terror and death that horrifies us. 
	
	
 On the Israeli side, despite the process, settlement has increased considerably, eating away at the supposedly autonomous Palestinian territories crisscrossed by "bypass roads." 
	
	
 Today, two forms of terrorism fuel each other. Palestinian terrorism, which existed on a very small scale in the time of Yitzhak Rabin, has taken on a dramatic dimension. But the Israeli response, with its "extra-judicial liquidations," is even more dramatic in a certain sense. It now resembles the destruction of the very people, so structured and organized is it. 
	
	
 Like any form of state terrorism, it is above all contradictory. Yesterday, Yasser Arafat was being asked to police the area he was supposed to be in charge of, while destroying the instruments of his power. Today, he is being completely isolated and the desire to drive him away is scarcely disguised. 
	
	
 Ariel Sharon's immediate exploitation of the 11 September massacres is an unmistakable sign. Sharon compared Arafat to Bin Ladin and Mullah Omar put together. Whom does he think he resembles, if not the perpetrator of the Sabra and Shatila massacres? 
	
	
 How to escape from this situation? From the current perspective, three solutions seem "logical." 
	
	
 The first is the expulsion of the Palestinians from what is known as Eretz Israel, from all of Mandatory Palestine. A recently assassinated minister favored this solution. Can we seriously imagine the crimes that would have to be committed to achieve this result? Can anyone believe that the Arab world could approve of it? What would then remain of the universal character of the prophets of Israel -- that of the second Isaiah, for example -- and of Israeli citizens' hope of one day living in peace in this region? 
	
	
 The other solution is the opposite of the first one: the departure of the Israelis to more hospitable climes, in the United States or Europe. It is absolutely impossible for the time being. But in the future? What would remain of the ideals of those who saw themselves as their liberators of their people and as builders? Asking this question at least serves as a reminder that, although many have already left, thereby reinventing the Diaspora, the Israelis want to stay and do not intend to end up like French Algeria. 
	
	
 The third solution consists of coexistence, whether it takes the form of two separate states or a federation or a confederation. 
	
	
 Two basic principles could still, perhaps, make it possible. 
	
	
 The first is that of not only civic, but also social and economic, equality. This principle applies primarily to the attitudes that must prevail during any future negotiations. It also applies for Palestinian citizens of Israel who, 53 years after the creation of the state, are still far from equal. It furthermore holds for the Israelis who decide to remain in Palestinian territory and who must no longer be encysted there. 
	
	
 The second is that of reciprocity. Any renunciation of sovereignty by either party must be compensated by the other. This applies to all the problems under discussion, including, of course, the issue of Jerusalem and of the refugees. 
	
	
 It must be acknowledged that the government of Ariel Sharon has so far taken the opposite tack and that, while he has grudgingly recognized the Palestinians' right to a state, it has been under conditions such that this state, reduced to a series of Bantustans, has no chance of living and developing peacefully. Extremists on both sides have clearly understood this and have derived nothing but encouragement from it. 
	
	
 The Israeli ambassador in France, Elie Barnavi, recently made two contradictory statements: That all those who, like Nurit Peled, believe that the Sharon government is a "government of death" could easily fit into a telephone booth... and that by their existence they constitute Israel's very honor. 
	
	
 We still want to hope that the "rest of Israel," as the prophets called it, is the "mustard seed" another prophet referred to. 
	
	
 We do hope so, against all hope. 
	
	
	


	
December 5, was a Wednesday like any other for the 24 executive directors of the International Monetary Fund [IMF]. Three meetings - on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays - under the chairmanship of the institution's director general, Germany's Horst Kohler, usually punctuate their weekly schedule. During these meetings, they review various subjects and in particular the achievements of "under program" countries. That particular morning, it was Argentina's turn. It is the victim of an explosive situation at the economic, political and social levels. And yet, the problem was disposed of in two hours. Since the economic targets the government had promised, particularly the one on a zero budget deficit, were not reached, the board felt it was unable to "recommend" releasing a new $1.264 billion tranche that had been scheduled for December as part of last year's $22 billion program for Argentina. 
	
	
 Shortly thereafter, the institution's spokesman, Thomas Dawson, declared "the [Argentine] authorities have to reach the program goals they set for themselves" before they can get any more money. Moreover, he found the measures taken by the government to control the [movement] of foreign exchange and limit the flight of capital were "regrettable", even though these measures were made more flexible later on. According to an eyewitness, this cut and dry, accounting-like decision taken by civil servants, who thus have the power of "life or death" over a country, was not the subject of any debate. It was taken following the presentation of a report by Chile's Thomas Reichmann, the chief of mission who had been sent to Buenos Aires. The figures spoke for themselves. At most, a few differences in sensitivity emerged over whether or not the issue should remain closed from one to two months or if the discussions with Argentina should continue. The latter was adopted in the end. This was the only concession made to a government that has been struggling to restructure its domestic public debt to avoid having the country simply default on its debt. 
	
	
 Unconditional Support 
	
	
 In essence, it seems that they all agreed on one thing: meeting a commitment is inviolable. This position is surprising all the same because the history of the IMF is lined with derogations. We have stopped counting the number of times financial bailout plans have been set up to help this or that government in difficulty. We also stopped counting the unconditional support the institution has given some heads of state, who are neither especially virtuous nor especially democratic, because it was in the political, commercial and economic interest of the United States to do so. 
	
	
 This was the case in particular for Russia, Brazil and now Pakistan. In the case of Russia, it was a matter of helping the former soviet giant consolidate its emerging democracy. For Brazil, the Fund intervened in October 1998, between two rounds in the presidential election, to support Fernando Henrique Cardoso's reelection because his macroeconomic options fell in line with the Fund's requirements, contrary to his leftist adversary, Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva. In the case of Pakistan, it is this country's geostrategic position in the current crisis that serves to justify the avalanche of loans and trade facilities that are being granted to Islamabad. 
	
	
 Argentina has none of these worthy arguments. Yet, over the past ten years, it has done everything it can to be considered one of the IMF's good pupils. The government adopted a fixed parity between the dollar and the peso in 1991 in order to stop unrestricted inflation. Buenos Aires privatized, on Washington's recommendation, all of its public companies. The government, without assets to sell and without the possibility of falling back on the devaluation of its currency, is now condemned to keep on asking for foreign capital to maintain its balance of payments in equilibrium. Hence, a foreign debt of $130 billion and the urgent need for an inflow of capital from the IMF to repay $2 billion in debt that is coming due on 19 December. In the event of non-payment, the country will find itself an outcast of the international financial community. 
	
	
 The IMF administrators' bookkeeping-based decision marks a toughening of its policy, which America's republicans, who are especially critical of the Fund's past largesse, have called for over the past years. The first illustration of a change in the position of the United States (the Fund's leading shareholder) toward countries that may squander the American taxpayer's money was the arrival in September of Ann Krueger, an ultraliberal American, as number two at the IMF. Moreover, the "Argentine case" falls at a bad time. President Bush now needs parliamentary votes to get more powers on trade negotiation matters and a green light on the economic stimulation plan that has been dragging along for the past two months. The president could not take any risk of ruffling the republicans. Furthermore, Argentina is not a priority for the Americans now, confides a member of the IMF. Also, the risk that its bankruptcy will cause a chain reaction and lead to a grave crisis among emerging nations is, according to economists, not very likely or at most limited. Brazil has had time to lessen its dependence on trade links with Argentina. The other emerging nations are calling on foreign capital less since the Asian crisis and a sharp ebb in investments would not have the dramatic impact that it had in 1997-1998. Will Argentina be declared bankrupt on 19 December? The fate of 30 million Argentines depends on this. Regardless of what happens, the current extremely perilous situation is another setback for the IMF. It has been following Argentina's national accounting with a magnifying glass for the past ten years and it has shown it is incapable of guaranteeing the country's financial equilibrium just as most of the countries that submit to its demands.

 The US President preferred a more realistic attitude, because it is hard to believe that it will be possible to fully eliminate pollutant gas emissions in one decade. What is also realistic is the idea that it will be easier to persuade the main polluting agents to take measures by providing incentives to them, rather than by constraint. No matter how cynical this may appear, the US administration is mainly concerned with getting out of the recession and with relaunching the economy, rather than with the greenhouse effect.	


	
The buffer zones that Ariel Sharon intends to establish are an explicit admission that Israelis can no longer live by the sword, that the occupation is not working, and Israeli reprisals are not meeting with success. Thinking of building a Great Wall of China in the Middle East, replete with elaborate fences and tunnels, is conceding that Israel is not safe, not a normal country. It cannot integrate itself into the region, it is an alien seedling and, thus, it is better to isolate and fortify itself as a lowly outpost. 
	
	
 A total disengagement from the Palestinians, complete with walls and razor wire, might provide Israel its long-desired security and might free it of the burden of trying to control seven million desperate Palestinians, any number of whom are willing to die in order to end the occupation. But separation will not mean an end to the occupation and no Israeli government can provide security as long as it persists in its efforts to maintain its presence beyond Israel's pre-1967 borders and to retain territories inhabited by millions of Palestinians. By now, it should be clear to everyone that retaliating against every act of Palestinian resistance with Israel's superior ability to punish Palestinians does not provide the security that Israelis are demanding. 
	
	
 The only way out of the current spiral of violence is for Israel to limit itself to areas within which it can assume responsibility for its citizens' security. This means a return to Israel's pre-1967 borders. 
	
	
 Practically speaking, a buffer zone will be near impossible to erect. A physical border between Israel and a new Palestinian state will be twisted and distorted to accommodate Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. Unilateral separation without a negotiated agreement could be realized - only if Israel is willing to uproot around 100 settlements. Sharon says flatly he will not withdraw from a single settlement. He thinks that every settlement is important and is determined that Israelis must retain as much land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as possible. 
	
	
 Then there is the eventual goal of the peace process: the coexistence of Israel with the state of Palestine. But Israel has not once deigned to propose that the Palestinians live with the Israelis as full citizens in the same sate. Israel does not want the Palestinians to be part of the same country, or have one of their own. 
	
	
 By a margin of 2-1, Israelis think Sharon has no plan to end the violence and the buffer idea buttresses this long-standing view. Sharon has not brought the Israeli public security. With grim determination, he has destroyed the peace process and the Oslo agreements. And now he doggedly continues to demolish and prevent any hope of a road to peaceful coexistence. Israelis do not wonder any longer how to get along with Palestinians but how to avoid the need for it. Sharon has ensured that Israelis are rapidly absorbing the lesson that no place in Israel can be considered safe. 
	
	
 A wall and miles of fences is not the best of solutions. Does anybody believe that the intifada can end as long as Israel persists in the occupation of the territories and Palestinians are willing to die in large numbers to deny Israel that privilege? 
	
	
	


	
BEIJING, March 6 (AFP) -- China's foreign minister on Wednesday pledged to expand "constructive and cooperative" relations with the United States, in a notably conciliatory performance at his annual get-together with the media. 
	
	
 "We are ready to work together with the US side to narrow differences, expand common ground, increase exchanges and promote cooperation in order to further push forward the constructive and cooperative ties," Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan told journalists. 
	
	
 In a press conference on the sidelines of the current full session of parliament -- his annual opportunity to present China's foreign policy objectives to the outside world -- Tang largely steered clear of subjects over which Beijing and Washington disagree. 
	
	
 Even when the perennially divisive issue of Taiwan was raised by reporters, he offered only mild and routine criticism of US policy towards the island. 
	
	
 China had always "firmly opposed" the US Taiwan Affairs Act, which mandates by law the US defense of Taiwan and forms the basis for US arms sales to the island, he said. 
	
	
 Tang called on Washington to uphold the so-called "one China policy" -- the centrepiece of Beijing's dealings with Taiwan which categorises the island is an inalienable part of mainland territory -- but failed to specifically condemn Washington's arms sales to Taipei. 
	
	
 However he stressed that Taiwan remained the crucial issue between the two. 
	
	
 "I wish to emphasize that the Taiwan question remains the most sensitive and most important issue at the core of the Sino-US relationship," he said. 
	
	
 Sino-US ties have greatly improved since Beijing backed the US fight against global terrorism and its bombing campaign of terrorist targets in Afghanistan following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States. 
	
	
 The tone of Tang's press conference was markedly different to that of last year's equivalent event, during which he roundly criticised United States arms sales to Taiwan. 
	
	
 Sino-US relations took a more serious dip a month afterwards during a crisis over the collision between a US surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet over the South China Sea. 
	
	
 Tang conceded there had been "twists and turns" following US President George W. Bush's accession to the US presidency in early last year, but said the relationship had improved with Bush's visits to China in October and last month. 
	
	
 "President Jiang and President Bush held an important meeting in Shanghai in October where they agreed that both countries would work together to build a constructive and cooperative relationship. 
	
	
 "This is a very important consensus," Tang said. 
	
	
 When asked whether the anti-terror alliance meant good relations between the country were based purely on expediency, Tang disagreed, saying cooperation "was long-term". 
	
	
 China will seek to improve the relationship still further during visits by President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Hu Jintao to Washington later this year. 
	
	
 Tang further announced that Liu Jieyi, the director general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry section in charge of arms control, was in Washington for talks on weapons proliferation and issues concerning the global security. 
	
	
 US accusations of China's alleged proliferation of weapons of mass destruction have long been countered by Beijing with loud opposition to US weapon sales to Taiwan. 
	
	
 Overall, despite a "grim and complicated" post September 11 international order, China still maintained that "peace, stability and development" remained the main themes characterizing the world environment, Tang said. 
	
	
	


	
That Angela Merkel, the chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Union, wanted the job had long been an open secret, although no one but she knew how far she was prepared to go. But it was the uncertainty with which her rival, Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber of the Christian Social Union, the CDU's Bavarian sister party, also shrouded himself that made the question of who would lead the Union parties into the 22 September elections as chancellor candidate against incumbent Gerhard Schroeder, so exciting. Mr. Stoiber has come a long way from his refusal to sacrifice himself for the CDU in an election that once looked impossible to win, through his statement that he would under no circumstances run against the wishes of Ms. Merkel and her party, to his willingness to take her on in a divisive vote if necessary. 
	
	
 Mr. Stoiber carefully tread the path to the candidacy, spurred on by many and reined in by others. But he let slip the opportunities to turn back, because the forces that drive him -- his desire to affect change, his sense of duty to his peers and his ambition -- would not permit him to pass up the biggest chance of his political life. Mr. Stoiber seized it once the CDU made clear that it preferred him to its own chairwoman. That has always been the basic premise for a CSU chairman to accept the candidacy on behalf of the bigger sister party. It does not, of course, guarantee success at the polls -- or even solidarity in the campaign. 
	
	
 Certainly, Mr. Stoiber has done everything in his power to spare himself the fate of his mentor, Franz Josef Strauss. Rather than force himself on the CDU, he waited to be called. Having marginalized their own leader, the CDU grandees cannot afford to leave the chancellor candidate in the lurch as well. The most cogent argument in Mr. Stoiber's favor is that he will be running as a hopeful and not as the ticket of last resort. The CDU chose him because it believes in victory. The government is floundering, more seriously than anyone would have thought six months ago. The Union parties could not have wished for a better situation from which to launch their campaign. If anyone in their ranks can turn this to their advantage, it is Mr. Stoiber. 
	
	
 Nonetheless, he will be made to realize that he cannot command the CDU, that his power base lies in Munich and not in Berlin, and that the invitation of kingmakers to accept the crown comes at a cost. Nor will Mr. Stoiber have any illusions of what it means to lead an election campaign, although he can be confident in the knowledge that what is at stake is not Edmund Stoiber, nor the Union, but Germany as a whole.	


	
AMMAN -- The unemployment rate among the country's 48,000 engineers has dropped by 1.5 per cent since last year, a senior official at the Jordan Engineers Association (JEA) said on Thursday. 
	
	
 The rate last year was around 8.5 per cent, but in the first two months of 2002 it dropped to 7 per cent, said JEA President Azzam Hneidi. The total of unemployed engineers currently stands at 3,360, he said. 
	
	
 The association last year provided 867 unemployed engineers with job opportunities in several public and private institutions, thereby contributing to the decline, according to Hneidi. 
	
	
 The association will continue contacting the government and private institutions to supply them with engineers, he added. 
	
	
 Both the JEA and the Ministry of Housing and Public Works last year trained 759 new engineering graduates over the course of one year to prepare them for job opportunities, he said. 
	
	
 One of the JEA's obligations stipulated in its bylaws is to provide training for its members. This training takes the form of a full-time internship lasting from six months to one year, during which graduates are placed in professional settings to gain firsthand experience in the workplace. 
	
	
 "The aim is to give the engineers a real chance to practise what they studied in theory at university," said Hneidi. 
	
	
 Engineers specialised in the electricity field, for example, are hired to work in an electric company for eight hours per day. 
	
	
 "The trainee is paid between JD120-150 per month, and the association defrays JD30-50 of that monthly salary," said the JEA official. 
	
	
 The association annually allocates JD100,000 for training graduates. This year it plans to increase the number of trainees to 1,000 graduates, which will require more funds. 
	
	
 "The association is willing to cover it," Hneidi said. 
	
	
 As the engineering sector has more graduates than job openings, the association's representative offices in the Gulf states look to bring engineers from Jordan to work in the Gulf, said Hneidi. 
	
	
 Unemployment prevails mainly among chemical, mechanical and civil engineering graduates, he said, adding that engineers specialised in electrical, computer and architectural engineering have no problem finding jobs. 
	
	
 The number of students in Jordanian public and private universities' engineering departments is around 6,000, excluding those in agricultural engineering. Around 2,000 new engineers enter the job market on an annual basis. 
	
	
 Currently, many engineering students in universities prefer to specialise in the electrical or computer disciplines because the demand for them is higher. 
	
	
	


	
Regular British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, Robin Cook signalled tonight. 
	
	
 His remarks came as the militia began talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar after Northern Alliance troops finally entered Kunduz. 
	
	
 SAS [Special Air Service] soldiers and their American counterparts are fighting alongside the Alliance as they have swept across large swathes Afghanistan. 
	
	
 But Commons Leader Mr Cook said: "If you look back over the past month there has been no situation in which we have put British troops into the ground civil war and I don't myself imagine that's going to change." 
	
	
 British troops remained on 48 hour stand-by but the situation was "better than anybody could have hoped for", according to Mr Cook. 
	
	
 "We will continue obviously to keep the situation under review, but frankly, I think we should welcome the fact that their presence has not been needed in Afghanistan. This is not a reverse, it's actually an advance," he added. 
	
	
 News of the Kandahar negotiations came after the Taliban control crumbled in their final northern stronghold of Kunduz following mass surrender. 
	
	
 The city's top Taliban commander was among thousands of Afghan and foreign troops who gave themselves up after days of talks interspersed with fighting. 
	
	
 However, night fell before the Alliance could secure the city, increasing the danger of militants fighting back. 
	
	
 Hours after the vanguard entered from the west, a tank column halted its advance from the east, fearing hostile fire. 
	
	
 The surrender took days to hammer out, primarily because hard core Taliban and foreign troops from Usama Bin Ladin's al-Qa'ida terror network did not want to give up. 
	
	
 The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold following the rapid collapse of their regime across the majority of the country. 
	
	
 Hundreds of foreign fighters captured in the siege of the northern city were killed in a prison riot at a fortress outside Mazar-e-Sharif, the Northern Alliance said. 
	
	
 But that did not stop Taliban commanders discussing the surrender of Kandahar, following calls from 70 Afghan tribal leaders for them to avert bloodshed. 
	
	
 "There are some talks and negotiations going on there (in Kandahar) with the Taliban to surrender themselves," Gen Mohammed Zaer Azimi said in Herat. 
	
	
 Ruud Lubbers, the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, said Afghanistan was not yet secure for aid agencies to operate in and "not enough" food had been taken into the country. 
	
	
 "It is not at all a secure environment," he told the programme. 
	
	
 "So although our international staff went back to Kabul and hope to go back to the other places ... one cannot say it is safe in the country and secure enough. 
	
	
 "So there is quite a job to be done in creating a secure environment for humanitarian assistance." 
	
	
 His concerns echoed those voiced by leading charity Oxfam, which said instability across the country was hampering aid efforts. 
	
	
 But the Prime Minister's official spokesman today said Tony Blair was pleased with the progress that had been made on the military, diplomatic and humanitarian fronts. 
	
	
 "The situation obviously remains fluid from hour to hour but it seems to be going in the right direction," the spokesman said. 
	
	
 The campaign so far showed Alliance military success was the best way of getting food in, he said. 
	
	
 He again stressed that Britain would need to see evidence before it became involved in military action in other countries. 
	
	
 "In terms of the war on terrorism we have always said this is a multi-faceted campaign but equally we have also said any future military action would have to be based on evidence," he said. 
	
	
 "This campaign is not over. We are still in the middle of fighting the war in Afghanistan." 
	
	
	


	
[Computer selected and disseminated without FBIS editorial intervention] 
	
	
 Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA) -- Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien said Monday he does not expect any surprise developments to come from U.S. President George W. Bush's visit to mainland China later this week. 
	
	
 "The United States has more than once briefed us on the main purposes of Bush's Asia tour before his departure and repeatedly guaranteed that Taiwan's interests won't be sacrificed during Bush's trip," Chien told a news conference. 
	
	
 Bush arrived in Japan Sunday at the start of a three-nation Asia tour that will also take him to South Korea and mainland China. 
	
	
 Noting that this is Bush's first visit to the Asia-Pacific area following his attendance at the annual informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum last October, Chien said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is keeping close tabs on the current trip. 
	
	
 According to Chien, the government has set up a special task force to facilitate communications with the United States and analyze relevant developments. "The task force is working around the clock to monitor Bush's visit to Japan, south Korea and mainland China," he added. 
	
	
 The minister further said that since the communication channels between Taiwan and the United States have been operating smoothly, MOFA can fully grasp any possible developments. "We hope that people will keep calm. They need not be nervous," he said. 
	
	
 Chien said he appreciated statements made by Bush prior to his departure that Taiwan is a friend of the United States and that the Taiwan Strait issue should be resolved peacefully. 
	
	
 Chien said the Republic of China government hopes that the United States will continue to play the role of "promoter, stabilizer and balancer" in cross-strait relations. 
	
	
 In his view, Chien went on, the main purpose of Bush's current Asia visit is to promote world peace and security. "Bush hopes to take advantage of his trip to forge a consensus with U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific area on his administration's fight against terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
	
	
 He said Bush is expected to discuss bilateral security cooperation, Japan's economic reforms and financial aid to Afghanistan in his talks with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. 
	
	
 During his trip to Seoul, Chien said, Bush is expected to exchange views with South Korean leaders on arms procurement and policies toward North Korea. 
	
	
 "As for the topics to be touched upon in Bush's talks with Beijing leaders, the agenda will include mainland China's agricultural market opening, religious freedom and human rights condition, missile shield and Taiwan Strait issues," Chien noted.	


	
BSE case reported in southwestern France 
	
	
 Text of report by French news agency AFP 
	
	
 Auch, 2 March (AFP): A fourth case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was recently confirmed in the Gers department [of southwestern France], the Gers prefecture announced on Saturday [2 March]. The animal concerned was a milk cow and the farm has not been named. In accordance with the new regulations which came into force last week, all the animals in the herd will be slaughtered except for those born after 1 January 2002, the prefecture said. The first two BSE cases in Gers were detected last August, and a third was confirmed at the end of January in a 6-year-old milk cow.

NIZHNY NOVGOROD. March 22 (Interfax-AVN) -A habitual criminal who escaped from a convoy and started a shootout in the Perm region overnight to Friday has surrendered to the police, a spokesman for the main police department in the Volga federal district told Interfax-Military News Agency on Friday. Sergei Serdyuk, 32, was convicted several times on charges of theft, assault amd car hijacking. He was detained in March 2002 once again. While being transported to the police department of the Komi- Perm autonomous region on Thursday, Serdyuk escaped from a convoy of the Kochevo police department. The incident happened on the Perm-Kudymkar motorway 6km from the Karagai village of the Perm region at about midnight. Materials contained in the criminal case brought against Serdyuk say that the man disarmed the convoy, got hold of four PM pistols, wounded the head of the criminal investigation subdepartment of the Kochevo police department, who commanded the convoy, captured the driver of the police vehicle and left in the direction of Perm. The car was stopped near the Krasnokamsk village, the shootout started, and Serdyuk escaped in a forest. No casualties were registered among policemen. Two PM pistols were found at the site. Serdyuk surrendered to the police at 8:20 a.m. Moscow time (0520 GMT) on Friday. Arms were confiscated from him, the spokesman said. @ 2002 Interfax-Military News Agency, All rights reserved.

 Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA) -- Relations between Taiwan and the United States have increasingly become "harmonious and close" since U. S. President George W. Bush took office and Bush's current mainland visit is unlikely to affect the two-way ties, a presidential aide said Thursday. 
	
	
 Secretary-General of the Presidential Office Chen Shih-meng said the U. S. has repeatedly assured Taiwan that Bush will stick to his commitments to help protect Taiwan and he will not do or say anything that could damage Taiwan's interests while visiting mainland China. 
	
	
 According to Chen, the main purpose of Bush's mainland trip is to thank Beijing for its cooperation in the U.S.-led anti-terrorist war following last year's Sept. 11 terror attacks on Washington and New York. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, Chang Shiao-yue, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated that the United States had briefed Taiwan on Bush's mainland visit before his departure and made it clear that the trip would not hurt Taiwan's interests. She added the ministry has set up a task force to monitor developments and deal with all contingencies.	


	
BEIJING, Feb 21 (AFP) - US President George W. Bush and Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Thursday carefully played down their countries' often glaring differences over Taiwan during the US leader's visit to Beijing. 
	
	
 Both scrupulously avoided combative talk on the issue, which has been a consistent source of tension between the countries for decades. 
	
	
 Bush, who arrived in China Thursday morning, said the United States hoped for a "peaceful settlement" to tensions between China and Taiwan and stressed Washington's policy on the island had not altered. 
	
	
 "The position of my government has not changed over the years," Bush reassured his hosts. 
	
	
 "We believe in the peaceful settlement of this issue." 
	
	
 Bush reiterated his support for the Taiwan Relations Act, under which the United States is committed to providing the island with the means to defend itself. 
	
	
 But he also had a thinly veiled message for leaders in Taipei, saying "we will urge there be no provocation". 
	
	
 Bush's comments appeared designed to reassure Beijing that Washington has not shifted from its long-standing policy of avoiding making any explicit commitment to come to Taiwan's defence should China invade. 
	
	
 The tone contrasted sharply with the mood last year when Bush signed off on the biggest US arms sales to Taiwan in a decade. The sales angered Beijing and fuelled concern that Washington's tougher stance might encourage Taiwan to declare formal independence. 
	
	
 Bush's comments also pleased Taiwan's government, which pronounced itself satisfied and thanked Bush for his backing. 
	
	
 "The press conference showed the result of the discussions entirely match our forecast," said Taiwanese Foreign Minister Eugene Chien. 
	
	
 He voiced his gratitude to Bush for "having honored his commitment" made to Taipei before the Asian trip, which also took Bush to Japan and South Korea. 
	
	
 Taiwan's foreign ministry spokeswoman had said ahead of Bush's departure for Asia that Washington had assured Taipei its interests would not be harmed. 
	
	
 However some officials voiced concern that China could secure concessions on Taiwan in return for supporting Bush on issues such as anti-terrorism and prevention of nuclear arms proliferation. 
	
	
 In his comments at the press conference, Jiang also avoided areas of contention over Taiwan, which split from the mainland in 1949 after the communist victory in China's civil war. 
	
	
 "To properly handle the Taiwan question is vital to the stability and growth of China-US relations," Jiang said. 
	
	
 "In my meeting with President Bush, I have elaborated on the Chinese government's basic position of peaceful reunification and 'one country two systems' for the solution of the Taiwan question." 
	
	
 "One country two systems" is Beijing's proposal to reunify with Taiwan while allowing the island some autonomy in a similar arrangement to that which saw Hong Kong return to Chinese rule in 1997. 
	
	
 Taiwan on Thursday also called on China to reopen rapprochement talks. 
	
	
 Premier Yu Shyi-kun asked Chinese leaders to set aside differences with the island and engage in talks in the aftermath of both their entries to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). 
	
	
 Beijing has said it will not reopen talks with Taipei unless the Taiwanese government embraces its definition of "one China", under which Taiwan is considered part of its territory. 
	
	
 This is rejected by Taiwan's pro-independence President Chen Shui-bian. Dialogue across the Taiwan Straits has been frozen since he took office in May 1999. 
	
	
	


	
BETHANY - The number of illegal immigrants in Swaziland seems to be increasing. Last month members of the Umbutfo Swaziland Defence Force [USDF] found 594 illegal aliens in the country. 
	
	
 The USDF found 43 Somalians inside two kombis in Maphiveni and 23 others were found without travel documents at Matsamo border and were handed over to the Horo police. At least 507 illegal Mozambicans have been found, as well as eight South Africans, two Tanzanians, and one Burundian. 
	
	
 According to the army spokesman, Corporal Nhlanhla Dlamini, the key areas where most of the immigrants were found was Lomahasha, Mhlumeni and Sitsatsaweni. "We have discovered that there is a certain family around Lomahasha, which is suspected of assisting illegal immigrants with shelter and transport. The army would like to request whoever is engaged in this criminal activity, to stop," he said. 
	
	
 Last month, 53 cattle were also stolen around the country, of which 17 were spotted inside Mozambique driven by three men armed with rifles thought to be AK47s. The Mozambican soldiers have promised to act quickly. 
	
	
 The USDF also found four stolen cars in different places in the country. These include a Nissan Skyline in Mafutseni, a Mercedes Benz, A Toyota and an Isuzu 2.5 diesel at Nkalashane. 
	
	
	


	
TAIPEI, Feb 21 (AFP) - Taiwan Foreign Minister Eugene Chien on Thursday hailed US President George W. Bush for not trading away the island's interests to Beijing. 
	
	
 Chien said the closed-door meeting between Bush and his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin suggested there remained differences to be tackled. 
	
	
 As to the Taiwan issue, Chien said: "The press conference showed the result of the discussions entirely match our forecast..." 
	
	
 Chien voiced his gratitude to Bush for "having honored his commitment" he pledged to Taipei before his Asian trip, which also took him to Japan and South Korea. 
	
	
 Taiwan's foreign ministry spokeswoman had said ahead of Bush's departure for Asia that Washington had assured Taipei its interests would not be harmed. 
	
	
 Taiwan's foreign ministry has set up an ad hoc group to monitor the trip around-the-clock and report to President Chen Shui-bian. Taipei's de facto embassy in Washington has been given a similar task. 
	
	
 Chien said he also hoped "Washington will continue to enhance its ties with Taipei while seeking to mend fences with Beijing." 
	
	
 Bush, who arrived in China Thursday morning, said the United States hoped for a "peaceful settlement" to tensions between China and Taiwan and stressed Washington's policy on the island had not altered. 
	
	
 "The position of my government has not changed over the years," Bush said. 
	
	
 "We believe in the peaceful settlement of this issue." 
	
	
 Bush reiterated his support for the Taiwan Relations Act, under which the United States is committed to providing the island with the means to defend itself. 
	
	
 Beijing has repeatedly threatened to take Taiwan by force should the island declare formal independence. 
	
	
 In a speech to the Japanese Diet (parliament) on Tuesday, Bush said the US would continue to support its allies in the Asia Pacific region. 
	
	
 "We will continue to show American power and purpose in support of the Philippines ... Australia ... and Thailand ... America will remember our commitments to the people on Taiwan," he said, without elaborating. 
	
	
 
	
	
	


	
US President Bush, after visiting Japan and South Korea, will follow with a visit to China. Whether Bush will, like Clinton, damage Taiwan's interests is receiving the deep concern of all quarters. The protection of Taiwan's interests under the US-Japan alliance structure is fairly strong. Before President Bush visits China, Japanese naval strategy expert Kawamura Sumihiko and missile expert Sato Mamoru were exclusively interviewed by a reporter of this newspaper. They reiterated the importance of Taiwan's strategic position and at the same time put forward their views with regard to the situation in the Taiwan Strait. 
	
	
 Kawamura: Japan and Taiwan are both exporting nations. Stable ocean traffic is an absolute necessity. Last year, approximately 5.1 billion tons of goods passed through the world's oceans, about one third of which passed through the sea areas of southern China. Half of this one third was transported to Japan through the sea areas near Taiwan. The traffic on Taiwan's seas is extremely important to Japan. If Taiwan becomes a part of China, all of Taiwan's sea areas will be threatened. China is currently in the process of actively expanding as a maritime nation. Its purpose is to ensure resources and the lives of a population of 1.5 billion people. However, China is not a nation that is able to abide by international rules, and for this reason, there will inevitably be conflicts on the ocean. Under these circumstances, Taiwan and Japan both must recognize clearly the important role of the navy. 
	
	
 Question: What is your appraisal of Taiwan's navy? 
	
	
 Kawamura: Frankly speaking, Taiwan's navy is worrisome. Anti-submarine combat strength is extremely low, and in particular there are many old style naval aircraft that, compared to Japan, are possibly 30 to 40 years behind. Torpedo strength is also insufficient. The Navy's problems are very large. For example, there is only one submarine attached to each naval base. It can only be said that this is nothing more than an embellishment and fundamentally cannot accomplish anything. Taiwan should make an all out effort to augment naval combat strength. In past Taiwan-US arms sale negotiations, the PC-3 early warning aircraft and the MH53 helicopter that Taiwan has made requests to purchase are entirely suitable to Taiwan's needs. The PC-3's intelligence exchange system is extremely important and is not inferior to the Aegis destroyer. 
	
	
 Question: Will the United States sell Aegis destroyers to Taiwan? 
	
	
 Kawamura: One of the reasons that the United States has all along not provided Aegis destroyers to Taiwan is that in the past the United States considered Taiwan's armed forces to be the armed forces of the Nationalist Party, not the armed forces of the nation. Nationalization of the armed forces after Lee Teng-hui (Li Teng-hui) and the loyal attitude of the armed forces after Chen Shui-bian (Ch'en Shui-pien) came into office have already gradually allowed the United States to feel at ease. Although Japan and the United States haven't recognized it, in reality, the United States, Japan and Taiwan currently are already situated in a kind of virtual alliance. I reckon that at the last stage, the United States will provide the Aegis destroyer to Taiwan. It is not possible that the Republican Party will get along with China, Taiwan can again wait for a little while. 
	
	
 Question: Where is China's true threat to Taiwan 
	
	
 Sato: China's threat to Taiwan is the use of the three methods of missiles, amphibious landing, and submarine blockades. The most likely method is to use missiles to threaten Taiwan psychologically. 
	
	
 Question: How should Taiwan respond to China's missile threat? 
	
	
 Sato: I gave a speech on this issue in Taiwan. Taiwan has some people who very obviously purposely play up China's use of force to scare Taiwan. In 1996, the Chinese People's Liberation Army indeed fired four missiles near Taiwan, but this was a kind of propaganda war. Before the United States attacked Afghanistan, it first explained the reasons to every nation of the world, and China using missiles to attack Taiwan is certainly not simple. If China only uses common warheads, at most, it would only make a few holes in Taiwan. If warheads with biological weapons are used, China has no means to justify this to international public opinion. During the Second World War, Germany fired 7,000 V1 and V2 missiles at England and England did not surrender. Recently, old Yugoslavia fired 3,000 missiles at Kosovo and Kosovo also did not surrender. This is an issue of will. 
	
	
 Question: What is the significance for Taiwan of the United States and Japan jointly researching TMD theater missile defense system technology? 
	
	
 Sato: After the 9-11 incident, the United States will be even keener on developing TMD. Taiwan is also very important to the United States, especially Taiwan's strategic position. The possibility of the TMD anti-missile system covering Taiwan in the future is very great. Currently, Taiwan's Patriot missiles are effective against guided missiles. I reckon that the probability of war occurring between China and Taiwan is smaller than small. Not using peaceful methods to resolve the Taiwan issue won't do, and I reckon that the US-Japan summit talks will discuss the issue of the two shores. 
	
	
 However, Taiwan announcing independence to the outside world is a variable. Taiwan announcing independence is not itself a problem, but because Taiwan announcing independence would bring unrest and a domino effect would occur with regard to Tibet and Xinjiang, this is China's greatest fear. There would be no difference between Taiwan announcing independence to the outside world and the current situation. Taiwan has no need to announce independence, and there won't be any problem if only the name "Taiwan" is used.

 Moscow, 9 November: Russia's Defence Ministry has denied Taleban assertions that Russian officers are serving in the Northern Alliance. "Formations of the anti-Taleban coalition do not include officers of the Russian armed forces," a high-ranking military official told Interfax on Friday. "Russia has provided only military-technical assistance to the Northern Alliance and continues to do so. Russian officers were not dispatched to Afghanistan either as unit leaders or as instructors," the official added. 
	
	
	


	

	
	
 One in four children in the KwaZulu-Natal capital of Pietermaritzburg has been orphaned by Aids, and the number is set to rocket in the next 10 years. 
	
	
 A study by Dr Neil McKerrow, chief paediatrician at Pietermaritzburg's Metropolitan Hospitals Complex, shows that 50 000 Aids orphans live in the city. The number rises to 100 000 if surrounding areas in the Midlands are included. 
	
	
 McKerrow estimates that the number of orphans in the Midlands will top 250 000 by 2010. 
	
	
 His figures refer to children under 16 who have lost their mothers, in line with a World Health Organisation definition. According to Statistics SA, the city has 193 000 children in that age group out of a total population of 573 000. 
	
	
 Although there are care centres and orphanages in Pietermaritzburg, McKerrow's study found that extended families and the community were willing to take in these children. 
	
	
 Six years ago McKerrow and a colleague at the Edendale Hospital, Annelise Verbeek, pioneered a study entitled Models of Care for Children in Distress, a term they coined for abandoned, displaced and orphaned children in the region. 
	
	
 They found that 6% of children in Pietermaritzburg were Aids orphans. Six years later, the number has risen to 25%. 
	
	
 At an informal meeting three weeks ago, the city council was told that, according to estimates from teachers, there were now as many as 100 000 Aids orphans in the city, but city health officials say these numbers appear to be too high. 
	
	
 McKerrow's estimates are based on household counts coupled with mathematical models used by the WHO. 
	
	
 KwaZulu-Natal has the highest rate of HIV infection in SA, with 36% of the population infected. McKerrow estimates there are 4.6 million orphans countrywide. 
	
	
 Yvonne Spain, the co-ordinator of Children In Distress, a network of more than 50 organisations and people, said communities were absorbing the children, "but the fact of the matter is that, as multiple deaths occur, that safety net will fall apart". 
	
	
 The director of the provincial Aids Action Unit, Dr Sandile Buthelezi, admitted the city faced "quite a problem" and suggested this week the figures might even be higher than McKerrow's. 
	
	
 He said: "The number of orphans is not a static thing. . . Every day an orphan is being created and I know the problem is enormous in the province." 
	
	
 Buthelezi said the provincial health department was working closely with the welfare community and the private sector to secure funding for bodies working with Aids orphans.

The federal and local authorities are currently preparing the ratification of the Kyoto international protocol on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases. Within the framework of that protocol, Belgium must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5 percent, compared to 1990, in the 2008-2012 period. Following the formal ratification of the Kyoto protocol by all the parliaments of the concerned countries, that protocol will become equivalent to a Belgian law. This implies -- whether or not one agrees with it -- that the Kyoto protocol will become binding for all of this country's inhabitants and institutions. 
	
	
 We readily accept that there are good intentions on the part of both the government and this country's various sectors to comply with the Kyoto standards. However, no broad social debate has yet been conducted on the crucial question: How much should each sector or target group contribute to achieving the Belgian Kyoto standard? Because this debate has failed to take place, it is understandable that all sectors (ranging from processing and manufacturing industrial sector, the electricity sector, the tertiary sector, and the transport sector to the residential sector) are currently doing their utmost to make their own future efforts as small (yet acceptable) as possible. 
	
	
 That is strikingly illustrated by Belgian large-scale industry, which has made great efforts over the past 10 years, over which energy intensity (energy use per unit of final product) has improved considerably. But a very considerable increase in production is expected in Belgium over the next 10 years, so that (even with very efficient processes) overall carbon dioxide emissions will certainly rise. Large-scale industry wishes to counter the expected rise with so-called benchmark covenants. 
	
	
 In a nutshell, benchmarking means that companies compare their energy efficiency with that of similar plants abroad. In these covenants, the companies pledge to rank among the world leaders in energy efficiency by 2012. In return for their commitment, they are exempted from additional (Flemish) emission restrictions, taxes on emissions, or negotiable emission rights. 
	
	
 Belgian industry is advocating benchmark covenants because it is afraid that an absolute limit would weaken considerably its competitive position with respect to similar companies in regions where the Kyoto protocol is not ratified. According to industry, relocation, with the resulting job losses, would be the only solution. However, this disregards the fact that arguments other than purely financial ones also play a part in the location decisions of companies in our region (favorable location near seaports, availability of know-how, well-educated personnel, stable political climate...). 
	
	
 Those covenants contain insufficient guarantees in themselves to achieve the Belgian/Flemish reduction targets in an economically efficient manner. 
	
	
 To begin with, the principle of benchmarking itself raises questions. If it were to emerge from the comparison with domestic and foreign companies that certain companies do not rank among the world leaders in energy efficiency, they would have to present a plan to achieve the highest energy efficiency on time (by 2012). But benchmarking is not sufficient from the viewpoint of economic efficiency (realizing the Kyoto restrictions on emissions at the lowest possible costs for the whole of society). 
	
	
 A cost-efficient division of efforts implies that each sector must limit its emissions to the point at which the additional costs for one extra ton of reduction are the same in all sectors. As a result, the costs of additional restrictions on emissions in industry must be compared with those of other sectors, such as the transport sector, households, the service sector, and so forth. Benchmarking guarantees only that companies belong to the top of their class, but says nothing about that class's performance as compared with the whole universe. 
	
	
 Second, benchmark covenants do not guarantee that the external climate costs of energy use (the increased greenhouse effect caused by the burning of fossil fuels) are correctly taken into account in the final products of the sectors concerned. However, taking into account these external climate costs is essential, because the users of energy-intensive goods are confronted in that way with the consequences of their choice of product. In that way, less energy-intensive products enjoy a relative advantage. 
	
	
 Third, questions can be asked about the emission restrictions that would be achieved by the covenants. Companies are urged in the proposed covenants to adopt measures which have an economic cost recovery period of less than five years or have an internal rate of return greater than that of a straight-lined obligation. But it is highly unclear whether these measures will lead to many extra reductions of emissions in comparison with the business as usual scenario without additional policy efforts. 
	
	
 Fourth is the contrast between the benchmark covenants' relative emissions standards and the Belgian Government's absolute restrictions on emissions within the framework of the Kyoto protocol. Since industry does not wish to let itself be pinned down on an absolute emissions ceiling, while the government feels itself committed to an absolute ceiling, industry is foisting the necessary efforts onto other sectors in society through the benchmark covenants. If industrial greenhouse gas emissions increase considerably over the next 10 years, that will have to be offset by a commensurate reduction of emissions in the transport sector, services, households, and so forth. 
	
	
 Thus the benchmark covenants could have very significant consequences for other sectors and target groups in our society, whereas the latter are not involved in the deliberations on those covenants. Hence a broad social debate on who should contribute how much to realizing the Kyoto standards is urgently necessary. 
	
	
 Despite these shortcomings, we believe that a role is reserved for the instrument of benchmark covenants. Thus the benchmark covenants could be reconciled with the European Commission's recent proposals for launching a unified market for European carbon dioxide emissions by 2005. This European proposal assumes absolute restrictions on emissions (companies obtain rights to emit a certain number of tons of carbon dioxide) and is hence irreconcilable at first sight with the Flemish benchmark covenants. However, the benchmark covenants could be opportune here for settling the initial allocation of emission rights. Companies could be allocated rights on the basis of an energy efficiency standard, on the condition that they are prepared to accept an absolute emissions ceiling. However, if they wish to emit more (because, for instance, their output is increasing considerably), they can do so provided that they purchase the necessary emission rights from companies which have a surplus of rights. 
	
	
 The great advantage of negotiable emission rights in that the system can lead to a cost-efficient division of effort among all sectors and target groups. By using the benchmark covenants to allocate emission rights initially, the good points of covenants are retained and their drawbacks are eliminated. 
	
	
 In any case, it is high time that a social debate be organized on the division of effort to achieve the Kyoto aims. Only a division that takes account of every sector's possibilities and is borne by the various target groups guarantees that Belgium will achieve its Kyoto aims without draconian measures having to be adopted at the eleventh hour.

 Tokyo, Jan. 17 Kyodo -- Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who just completed a whirlwind tour of five Southeast Asian nations, said Thursday he longed for more leisurely trips -- but added that may have to wait until he leaves his post. 
	
	
 "I would like to visit various countries at a more leisurely pace -- meet with the people of the land and travel not only to the capital but also to rural cities for sightseeing," the premier told a gathering in Tokyo. 
	
	
 "But when I think of my duties as prime minister, I can't visit one country and not go to the other, or stay in one country for three days and stay in the other for only a day. If I am to visit several countries in a limited time, it is always one or two days at best," he said. 
	
	
 "Of course, if I step down as prime minister, I can visit one country for a week each," he said. 
	
	
 But the premier also said that although short, he thinks his visits to the countries are still meaningful. 
	
	
 "There is a saying, seeing is believing. Even if it's only for a day or two, it is significant to visit a country and exchange views with the people of the country in person," he said. 
	
	
 Koizumi made a weeklong tour of the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore earlier in the month. He stayed for less than a day in most countries.	


	
Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- China urged the United States on Thursday to abide by the "one China policy", warning that any act to trample upon the Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques could result in a "very unfavorable" impact on relations between the two countries. 
	
	
 The question of Taiwan, which relates to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, is an essential and most important issue and is at the heart of Sino-U.S. relations, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue. 
	
	
 China hopes the United States will not do anything against the spirit of the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques, she said. 
	
	
 Zhang made the remarks at a news briefing in response to a question about the Taiwan official Tang Yiau-min's recent visit to the United States. 
	
	
 Zhang replied that Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing has put forward China's stand on the matter while making strong representations to the U.S. government with the hope that the United States treats the matter seriousness it deserves. 
	
	
 She said during the U.S. President Bush's working visit to China last month, state leaders of both countries agreed that Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Hu Jintao would visit the United States this year. 
	
	
 However, within one month of Bush's visit, the U.S. has already done several things which are against the spirit of the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques. 
	
	
 Zhu said the U.S. side should stop interfering in China's internal affairs by interfering in the Taiwan issue. 
	
	
	


	
KHARTOUM, Feb 13 (AFP) - Sudanese rebels have released a group of fishermen they had held for the last six months after charging that their boat belonged to the Sudanese government army, their employer said Wednesday. 
	
	
 Salmah Trading and Investment Company said its fishermen, who were captured last August while fishing in the Fangak area in south Sudan's Upper Nile region, were set free Tuesday by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). 
	
	
 "The release was due to tremendous efforts by the citizens who benefit from the company's services," the company said in a statement received by AFP, without elaborating further. The statement did not indicate the exact number of the freed fishermen but an official of the company said they were originally 11 in number.

Mugabe must be confronted with constitution issue 
	
	
 Lovemore Madhuku 3/21/02 1:40:54 AM (GMT +2) 
	
	
 IT will be a monumental tragedy for Zimbabwe and the future of the democratisation process if we fail to draw proper and useful lessons from the debacle surrounding the just-concluded presidential election. I must warn at the outset that there are two groups of persons whose analyses must be handled with caution. The first group is the media. The second group is that of "winning" and "losing" politicians. 
	
	
 These two groups dominated the pre-election period with all sorts of analyses and predictions whose value is yet to be ascertained. 
	
	
 Yet I must declare my interests at the outset. From those very first days sometime in early 1997 when, alongside colleagues like Tendai Biti, Welshman Ncube, Brian Kagoro, Priscilla Misihairabwi, Everjoice Win and Tawanda Mutasa, I participated in formulating the concept of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), it has been clear to me that the sole purpose of the current Zimbabwean constitution is to preserve and protect the rule of ZANU PF. 
	
	
 My view then, and indeed those of my colleagues, was that a democratic environment in which free and fair elections are the norm, and in which citizens enjoy real freedoms, could only be created if a new, democratic and people-driven constitution were put in place. In terms of that view, it is almost impossible to change the government through an election conducted in terms of the current constitution. 
	
	
 This is the view I still hold so strongly that I must confess it may cloud my assessment of the just-concluded presidential elections. 
	
	
 There is little doubt that the presidential election was neither free nor fair. An election which fails to meet the standard of being "free and fair" produces an illegitimate outcome. 
	
	
 This much must be regarded as admitting of no doubt. However, this says nothing about the way forward. This election was not stolen on March 9 and 10 2002, nor is the outcome illegitimate merely on the allegations of rigging arising from the events of the polling days. 
	
	
 The lesson to be learnt from this poll is that until Zimbabwe has a genuinely democratic constitution enshrining universally recognised norms and institutions for the holding of an election, a free and fair ballot will remain a mirage. 
	
	
 Politicians who in the run-up to the election peddled theories about how the "will" of the people would prevail notwithstanding the labyrinth of constitutional provisions loaded against a free and fair election must now admit that they were wrong. Most of the problems faced in this election have their roots in the defective nature of our constitutional framework. I now proceed to illustrate this truth. 
	
	
 First, the voter registration process was not transparent and was conducted in such a way as to favour the ruling party. The main reason for this lack of transparency is that in terms of the current constitution and laws, voter registration is conducted by officials appointed by, and answerable to, the President. 
	
	
 In other countries, this process is handled by an Independent Electoral Commission which is an impartial body and whose independence is guaranteed by the constitution. In our case, the so-called "supplementary voters' roll" was nothing but a list of names of ZANU PF supporters compiled under dubious circumstances but it was given legal validity by President Robert Mugabe acting is terms of the current constitution and laws. 
	
	
 Secondly, the designation of polling stations, as is now well known, was specifically done in a way that favoured ZANU PF by granting ridiculously few polling stations in urban areas. This was done by officials appointed by, and answerable to, Mugabe. In other countries, this is done by an Independent Electoral Commission, which is constitutionally enjoined to act impartially. 
	
	
 Third, it is alleged that some key election officials such as presiding officers were Central Intelligence Organisation operatives. In other countries, there is no scope for such madness. An Independent Electoral Commission appoints professional election officials. 
	
	
 Fourth, there were the so-called "no-go areas" in Mashonaland Central, West, East and some parts of the Midlands. Parliament also passed the Public Order and Security Act which the police deliberately misinterpreted to suppress the opposition. 
	
	
 Our constitution does not specifically provide for political rights such as free and equal campaigning platforms for competing political parties. If such rights had been enshrined, it would have given the opposition the right to approach the courts for orders directing the police to facilitate free campaigning in the so-called no-go areas. 
	
	
 Fifth, equal access to the public media is not guaranteed by our constitution. This enabled the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation to abuse its position by broadcasting ZANU PF propaganda only. 
	
	
 Finally, and more significantly, the President enjoys enormous powers under the current constitution which he used to further his electoral chances. It was the President who directed that there be tripartite elections in Harare. And in doing this, he overrode court orders to the contrary. 
	
	
 The tripartite elections contributed to what ultimately became a "low" turnout in Harare. 
	
	
 After the Supreme Court nullified the General Laws Amendment Act, the President used his powers to reinstate most of its provisions through a statutory instrument. Thus, it was the President who banned postal voting by all Zimbabweans outside their constituencies except members of the army and the police. The latter are alleged to have voted for Mugabe. 
	
	
 The ban on monitoring of elections by civic society was also reinstated. There were other countless examples of the President's use of the powers he enjoys under the current constitution to mould the electoral process in his favour. 
	
	
 The conclusion to be reached from this whole picture is that under the current constitutional and legal framework for the holding of presidential elections, it is almost impossible to vote out an incumbent President. It was naive for the Movement for Democratic Change to believe that the people's anger against Mugabe was, in itself, sufficient to carry the day in an election, whatever the circumstances. 
	
	
 The issue is not about Mugabe. If Mugabe were to announce his retirement before the expiry of his six-year term and ZANU PF were to field any of his less illustrious colleagues as a presidential candidate, without a fundamental change to the rules, Zimbabweans will learn an even more bitter lesson: ZANU PF will "steal" that election again. 
	
	
 We do not need to wait for that scenario before we embrace the need to fight for a new constitution. We have learnt our lesson and it will be irresponsible to seek to dispute this clear fact. 
	
	
 This brings us to the way forward. Two points must be made. 
	
	
 First, there has been no spontaneous uprising against Mugabe notwithstanding the widespread disbelief that greeted his victory among many voters, particularly those in urban areas. ZANU PF had anticipated such an uprising, hence the massive intimidatory show of force that was evident in the deployment of security forces in every part of the country during and after the announcement of the election results. 
	
	
 Secondly, key African countries have accepted Mugabe's victory while almost the entire Western world has "rejected" the election results. These two points are crucial in any discussion of the way forward. 
	
	
 Various options have been discussed, but the better way forward is to confront the Mugabe regime with the constitutional question. Constitutional reform is at the heart of any new democratic discourse in Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 Mugabe must be forced to yield to a new process of constitutional reform leading to a new constitution. There must be mass action for a new constitution. 
	
	
 Mass action for a new constitution places Mugabe in a difficult situation. He cannot be heard to defend the current constitution, which has been roundly condemned by all. He has used the current constitution to stay in power. 
	
	
 Even the African observers who endorsed Mugabe's re-election have also criticised the constitutional framework governing elections in Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 More fundamentally, the struggle for a new constitution is a question of principle, not personalities. It is a legitimate struggle which Mugabe cannot dismiss as a Western imperialist ploy because its demands are clear and unambiguous: a more democratic system of government, a more democratic framework for conducting elections, an expanded Bill of Rights and so on. 
	
	
 Mugabe has no moral excuse for shooting people merely demanding a new constitution. 
	
	
 The masses required for such a struggle to succeed need not be substantial. This struggle does not need a spontaneous uprising. A core of determined and committed Zimbabweans is sufficient for this purpose. 
	
	
 It is critical that a new constitution be in place as soon as possible so that any future election is held in a transparent and credible manner. 
	
	
 A presidential election is not necessarily six years away. Under the current constitution, the President has no powers to designate a successor, should he decide to retire. A fresh election must be held within 90 days. 
	
	
 The same situation arises if the President dies while in office. Never again should Zimbabweans go into an election under the current constitution. 
	
	
 A criticism which has been levelled against this way forward is that mass action aimed at confronting Mugabe with a demand for a new constitution translates into recognising him when in fact his government is illegitimate. This is useless sophistry. 
	
	
 Mugabe is a political fact. In legal jargon, to those who do not recognise his presidency, he remains the de facto President. It is him who must be confronted with such a demand as constitutional reform. 
	
	
 The NCA last December completed a draft constitution which Mugabe, through Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa, refused to receive. That draft must be forced on Mugabe and the NCA hopes that Zimbabweans will join in this noble cause to put in place a secure framework for good governance in Zimbabwe.

The Argentine TV station Todo Noticias ["All News"] reported yesterday that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Saturday night telephoned Cordoba Province Governor Jose Manuel de la Sota, of the Justicialist Party (PJ) -- who once served as ambassador to Brazil -- to voice his concern over incidents in the country. 
	
	
 "Cardoso told De la Sota that the images of the protests at the Plaza de Mayo show a country on the verge of a civil war," one of the channel's journalists commented. 
	
	
 According to the reporter, the Brazilian president apparently advised De la Sota to move forward the elections, initially slated for March 2002. But neither Itamaraty nor the Planalto Palace confirmed the president's phone call to the governor of Cordoba. 
	
	
 Legislators Request Action from the Brazilian Government 
	
	
 Concern has spread to Brazilian legislators. Violent attacks at the Argentine legislature sounded alarm bells in the Brazilian political arena, to the point that senators of the official and opposition parties defended more concrete support from the Brazilian Government for Argentina. Deputy Jose Genoino (Workers Party -- Sao Paulo) said that the wave of looting threatens Argentine democracy. He asked that Brazil promote meetings in the South American continent, or serve as intermediary in negotiations with international institutions. 
	
	
 "This is an unpredictable, anarchical situation. We don't know where it will go, against whom. It is dangerous! In addition to Argentina there are other countries in crisis, such as Colombia and Venezuela. We have a very risky scenario. Any step backward for democracy on the continent would be a disaster. Brazil cannot stand by with its hands folded just watching all of this," Genoino affirmed. 
	
	
 PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] President Jose Anibal (Sao Paulo) said that Cardoso has already placed himself at the disposal of the Argentine Government to talk to international financial institutions. He noted, "Brazil should adopt an open posture with relation to Argentina, which is experiencing a tragedy." 
	
	
 For Jose Agripino Maia, PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader in the Senate, although Brazil has detached itself from Argentina, it should not disregard the message of the crises that is devastating the neighboring country. 
	
	
 "The political warning must be heeded. Either one pays attention to the will of the people or what happened will happen." Maia commented. 
	
	
 Senator Heloisa Helena (Workers Party -- Alagoas) said that Latin American countries should always join together to speak with international economic institutions, in order to maintain autonomy in their economies: "Now we see what happens when one country abdicates its financial autonomy. I hope that this can alert the Brazilian Government to revise its relationship with the IMF." 
	
	
 Analysts: Lack of Alternative for Power 
	
	
 Political scientists agree: Argentina lacks a political force that can stand up to Peronism and Radicalism. This is viewed as the main impediment to the establishment of political order in the country. USP [University of Sao Paulo] professor Emir Sader believes that Peronists will remain in power after the elections, slowly growing weaker, allowing room for the emergence of new leadership. 
	
	
 "The degree of pauperization will be brutal. Everything depends on how long it takes for Peronism to burn out and new leadership to emerge," Sader said. 
	
	
 For the political scientist, Argentina cannot wait for assistance from the American Government. Latin America is no longer important because the focus now is on global security and no longer on the international economic order. 
	
	
 Sader affirmed, "The new policy of (US President George W.) Bush is to permit decay. The concern now is security. All eyes are on Pakistan, China, and Russia." 
	
	
	


	
MOSCOW. Feb 21 (Interfax) - Russia's Interior Ministry is looking into a report about Russian entrepreneur Viktor Bout's involvement in arms supplies to the al-Qaeda terrorist organization. 
	
	
 "Deputy Interior Minister Nikolai Bobrovsky ordered a detailed probe and verification of this information," Interior Ministry spokesman Yuri Shuvalov told Interfax on Thursday.	


	
HONG KONG, March 26 (AFP) - China has disallowed a routine port call in Hong Kong for an American naval vessel, a spokeswoman for the US consulate said Tuesday. 
	
	
 "The Chinese government denied a requested visit by the USS Curtis Wilbur, a destroyer, to visit Hong Kong from April 5 to 9," she said adding, "this would have been a routine port call." 
	
	
 "No reason was given for the disapproval," the spokeswoman added. 
	
	
 The bar on the USS Curtis Wilbur with some 346 crew is seen as reflecting Beijing's anger over Washington's decision to allow Taiwanese Defense Minister Tang Yao-ming to visit Florida for a military conference this month. 
	
	
 Beijing has twice summoned the US ambassador for dressings down over the issue, while a state-controlled newspaper reported last week that China was preparing to cancel naval exchanges with the United States in retaliation. 
	
	
 The last time such a request was turned down was in May last year following the collision of a US spy plane with a Chinese fighter jet in international air space over the South China Sea on April 1, 2001. 
	
	
 However, US naval visits to Hong Kong resumed in July. 
	
	
 There were two other similar episodes of permission being denied before that since the 1997 handover of the former British colony to China. 
	
	
 One of them was after the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia was bombed, killing three people, in the US-led NATO air campaign three years ago. 
	
	
 When Hong Kong was under British rule, the US navy made up to 65 port calls a year and Beijing had agreed the stopovers would continue after the territory returned to Chinese sovereignty. 
	
	
	


	
STATE VISIT: The US president is getting good reviews from political experts for refusing to restate the `three nos' and declining to endorse peaceful reunification 
	
	
 As US President George W. Bush wrapped up his six-day visit to Asia yesterday, analysts gave their thumbs up to his determination to voice his firm support for Taiwan despite pressure from China to do otherwise. 
	
	
 "We felt gratified and relieved after watching Bush stick to his principles on the issue of Taiwan. He did not make any concessions, even after his meetings with the Chinese leaders in Beijing," said Cheng Tuan-yao, research fellow at the Institute of International Relations in National Chengchi University. 
	
	
 While past trips to China by US presidents have produced agreements or statements that have damaged Taiwan's interests, Bush's visit only enhanced the nation's confidence in his administration, Cheng said. 
	
	
 "Bush has made the first correct step by spurning his predecessor's appeasement of China. Notably, he didn't restate the so-called `three nos' policy," said DPP legislator Parris Chang (Chang Hsu-ch'eng) of Bush's remarks on Taiwan during his two-day trip to Beijing that concluded yesterday afternoon. 
	
	
 Former US president Bill Clinton agitated Taiwan when he gave the so-called "three nos" speech during his visit to China in 1998. The "three nos" include no support for an independent Taiwan; no recognition of "two Chinas'' or one China and a separate Taiwan; and no support for Taiwan's entry into international organizations that require members to be states. 
	
	
 "Bush has been very forthcoming in stating the US commitment to defend Taiwan against the possible use of force by China," said Chang, a specialist in international relations. 
	
	
 Bush reitered his desire for a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue several times during his trip to Beijing. The US president also declined to endorse China's version of a "peaceful unification" between Taiwan and China, reflecting the longstanding US position on cross-strait relations, analysts said. 
	
	
 "Of course he would not use the term of `peaceful reunification' ... because the American position is that relations between Taiwan and China should be open-ended," Chang said. 
	
	
 "The three communiques have not committed the US to peaceful reunification," he added. 
	
	
 China's Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, in a speech in Washington earlier this month, urged the US to support "peaceful unification." 
	
	
 But Bush's refusal to respond to a similar push by a student yesterday during the question-and-answer session of his talk at Tsinghua University showed that the US president stuck to the US existing policy, according to analysts. 
	
	
 Cheng pointed out what he saw as the implications of Bush's remarks on missile defense. 
	
	
 "Bush said any missile-defense system was to protect friends and allies of the US from countries with massive destructive capabilities. Although he did not mention Taiwan directly, the implication of this remark seemed to be that Taiwan was not to be excluded," Cheng said. 
	
	
 Bush described Taiwan as a "good friend" of the US during his weekly radio address to the US public that aired last week within hours of his departure for Asia. 
	
	
 Bush's mention several times of the Taiwan Relations Act, the 1979 US law that pledged that the US would supply Taiwan with the defensive weapons it needed to fend off a Chinese attack, also reflected his firm support for Taiwan, analysts said. 
	
	
 China has tried to highlight and accentuate the Taiwan issue during Bush's trip to China, but the US agenda rested instead on anti-terrorism and China's proliferation of arms sale to countries like Iran and Pakistan, Chang argued. 
	
	
 But as Bush concluded his trip to Asia yesterday, it was clear that China failed to elicit from him a statement on the "three nos" and on opposition to Taiwanese independence, Chang said. 
	
	
 The US' rising concerns over China's military expansion and its appreciation for Taipei's support for the US-led war against terrorism drove Bush to stand firm in his support for Taiwan, the DPP legislator said. 
	
	
 The Pentagon's quadrennial defense review issued last September -- which highlighted the rising Chinese threat -- and the recent testimony by the CIA director to the US Senate on China's military modernization were indicative of the Bush administration's perception of China as a growing threat to US national security. 
	
	
 "These two reports seemed to indicate that the Bush administration took China's rising military threat more seriously than did the Clinton's administration. And therefore, the US is much more forthcoming in voicing its support for Taiwan," Chang said. 
	
	
 Fresh from his trip to Washington, where US government officials highlighted Taiwan's contribution to the war against terrorism, Chang said, "Even as a small country, we stood with the US at that critical moment, and the US appreciated that and has reciprocated what we've done."	


	
China has launched three unmanned spacecraft consecutively and exhibited to the world the capsules recovered. People have seen the true features of these space capsules. What exactly then is a manned spaceship? 
	
	
 It is learned that the manned spaceship will have a liftoff weight of about eight tonnes, and is less than 10 meters long and 3.5 meters in diameter. It can carry two to three astronauts and continue to cruise in space for more than 20 days. 
	
	
 The spaceship has been designed with comprehensive reference to the Russian spaceship Soyuz. The spaceship is composed of three cylindrical capsules, with the orbiter capsule fitted on the forefront. Its interior is equipped with corresponding facilities for space observation and space drug and microgravity tests. The return capsule, connected to the orbiter capsule, is the cockpit of the astronauts and the only capsule that will reenter the atmosphere for landing. Three reclining seats will be installed in the capsule for astronauts. Instrument panel, control shaft, and optical telescope will be installed below the seats. At the rear of the spaceship is the propulsion capsule to provide thrust to the spaceship in orbital control and return to earth. In accordance with the plan, China's manned spaceship will conduct a series of scientific tests and earth observation after it is launched into space. 
	
	
 Space technology will not only be used for civilian, but also for military purposes, and there is no exception for China. It is speculated that the spaceship will almost certainly be equipped with facilities relating to military observation and attack on enemy satellites. Therefore, the manned spaceflight will enable China to have preliminary space combat capability. 
	
	
 According to the experience of the United States and Russia, one of the greatest problems of manned spaceship is inadequate power supply. The solar energy batteries usually cannot meet the needs of numerous equipment on a spaceship. However, it is understood that China has successfully resolved this problem to provide sufficient power supply for its spaceship. After completing the orbital flight, the spaceship will adjust itself to the return position by following ground command and ignite the engine to change to the orbit for returning to the earth. Before gliding into the atmosphere, the orbiter and propulsion capsules will be discarded. 
	
	
 By referring to the designs of the Russia spaceship Soyuz, it is very possible that China will apply the lift control technology in its manned spaceship. This technology will enable the spaceship to limit its mobility in the atmosphere. In the altitude of about several thousands of meters, the return capsule will eject the parachutes to further reduce the speed. It is reported that in the past China's recovery site for returning satellites was in the mountains of Sichuan Province. 
	
	
 To facilitate recovery and rescue in future manned spaceflight, the recovery site will be located in sparsely populated grassland or the wilderness. Judging from the selection of recovery sites for the two previous flights, the site for recovering the manned spaceship may be situated in the grassland of Inner Mongolia. 
	
	
 The next step after the land recovery, China may change to recovering the manned spaceship on the sea. 
	
	
 An informed source has said that it can be seen that the designs for China's manned spaceflight have taken into consideration future modifications. For the next flight, the top of the spaceship's orbiter capsule may be installed with a docking module for docking tests between two spaceships. The concerned person said that this is a prelude to China's space station development plan.	


	
Lugano, 8 Jan -- Spanish-Israeli businessman Felipe Turover has denounced the Swiss in front of the European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg for having put his life in danger in its case against [Secretary of the Russian-Belarus Union] Pavel Borodin, former Kremlin senior aid accused of money laundering, according to a communique Tuesday from his lawyer Niccolo Salvioni. 
	
	
 According to the communique, received at the Swiss news agency ATS, the 37-year-old M. Turover --considered by the Swiss courts as a key witness -- had asked the Swiss Government and the Swiss Public Ministry that he be put under protection, believing himself threatened by the Russian Mafia because of leaks by Swiss court officials. 
	
	
 Pavel Borodin, the former property manager of the Kremlin, is suspected of having laundered some $25 million in secret commissions which came from two Swiss companies headquartered in the Tessin (southeast) region -- Mercata, and Mabetex -- in exchange for being awarded the contracts for the renovation of the Kremlin and the Russian presidential aircraft in 1995 and 1996. 
	
	
 At the end of June 2001, the Swiss Public Ministry rejected a complaint from Turover against a former Ministry official, Carla Del Ponte -- today a lawyer with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) -- in which Turover accused her of putting his life in danger during this case; in November the rejection was upheld by the Federal Tribunal, which is Switzerland's highest court. 
	
	
 Turover accused Mme. Del Ponte of having furnished -- in 1999 when she headed the Swiss Public Ministry -- confidential information to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera which made numerous revelations about the Mabetex-Borodin affair, including the existence of credit cards in the name of the Yeltsin family. The newspaper presented Turover as a key informer in this affair and the Spanish-Israeli businessman affirmed that these leaks had put his life in danger. 
	
	
 Today, Turover is accusing the Swiss authorities of having violated on several occasions the European Convention on Human Rights. The communique from his lawyer affirms that the Swiss authorities, the Federal Tribunal, and the Swiss Public Ministry "have given proof of illegality and political persecution." 
	
	
 Mabetex, a construction company, is suspected of having landed public contracts for renovating the Kremlin and other Russian official buildings by offering bribes worth a dozen million dollars in 1995 and 1996 to close associates of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, including to Borodin. 
	
	
 At the request of the Geneva court, Borodin was arrested in the United States January 17, 2001. He agreed to be extradited to Switzerland April 7th. After six days in preventive detention, he was released on bail for $3 million. 
	
	
	


	
A cargo ship intercepted in the Channel after a tip-off that it might be carrying terrorist materials was today given the all clear, police said. 
	
	
 The 450ft long vessel Nisha, carrying 26,000 tonnes [metric tons] of raw sugar, was stopped on Friday morning [21 December] amid fears it could be transporting noxious, hazardous or dangerous substances. 
	
	
 But after a detailed examination of the ship, which is currently moored off the Isle of Wight, nothing suspicious was found, police said. 
	
	
 Assistant Commissioner David Veness, head of Scotland Yard's specialist operations, said: "New information, combined with the relentless efforts of scientific experts, our detailed knowledge of the ship and its movements, and very careful examination of the vessel over the last three days leads us to be completely satisfied that the Nisha is not a suspicious vessel and does not pose a danger." 
	
	
 The Nisha was halted by anti-terrorist police, the Royal Navy and Customs and Excise officials after a tip-off that it contained "terrorist material" and the Royal Navy frigate HMS Sutherland intercepted her in international waters, about 30 miles south of Beachy Head. 
	
	
 The MV Nisha is operated by the Great Eastern Shipping Company, based in Bombay, India. 
	
	
 It had recently stopped in the east African country of Djibouti, a neighbour of Somalia, which has been linked to Usama Bin Ladin's al Qa'ida terror network. 
	
	
 The ship had sailed from Mauritius and was carrying a cargo of sugar to the Tate &amp;amp; Lyle refinery on the Thames at Silvertown in east London, according to the company. 
	
	
 Police had earlier indicated they expected the search to take a number of weeks, because of the vessel's size and design, but experts completed the job today. 
	
	
 Anti-terrorist officers said they were also satisfied that the ship's crew and owners had not committed any offence. 
	
	
 Mr Veness said the ship was now in a position to continue its journey, but completion of the voyage was still subject to consultation with all interested parties. 
	
	
 He added: "We have not detected any signs of interference and we do not believe that the seals of the holds have been interfered with. 
	
	
 "We had anticipated that detailed examination of the ship might take rather longer. This was to ensure that there was no chance of risk to the public. 
	
	
 "The cargo ship Nisha was intercepted and boarded as part of an intelligence-led operation. 
	
	
 "This was the right and proper course of action to take. Thankfully, the ship has been proved not to pose a danger to the public." 
	
	
 Mr Veness praised the crew and ship's owners for their co-operation and said: "We remain vigilant and are totally committed to ensuring the safety of the public. 
	
	
 "We would take similar action in the future if there was a potential risk to the public." 
	
	
 The Nisha's cargo of raw sugar is owned by the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate, which had chartered the vessel, and the vessel was due to dock in east London yesterday. 
	
	
 The chairman of the British arm of the Great Eastern Shipping Company, Sudhir Mulji, confirmed that the vessel had stopped over at Djibouti before its current journey to drop off American grain as part of a food aid shipment. 
	
	
 The ship then went on to Mauritius to pick up the sugar and left on November 20 to transport it to Britain. 
	
	
 The Great Eastern Shipping Company, which has offices in India, London, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, is a leading Indian shipping and offshore service provider with a fleet of 38 cargo-carrying vessels.	


	
Settlers Have Taken Palestine Hostage 
	
	
 A few days ago the parties in the Palestine conflict found themselves at a crossroads. The escalation of the conflict has now cost over 1,000 people their lives in the space of the past 18 months. 
	
	
 One-third Israelis, two-thirds Palestinians. Circumstances have led to a situation where today the two parties in the conflict find themselves on the road that leads swiftly to the abyss. 
	
	
 On Thursday the Arab Summit in the Lebanese capital of Beirut ended with the adoption of a resolution whose content illustrated how far the Arab world has come since the summit that took place in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum in 1967, shortly after the Israeli victory in the Six Days War. 
	
	
 It was then that the Arab heads of state adopted the three noes: no to negotiations with Israel, no to recognition, no to peace. 
	
	
 On Thursday the summit adopted a resolution that proposed the recognition of the Jewish state, normal relations, and an end to the conflict in return for Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories that Israel has occupied for almost 35 years. 
	
	
 Even the mention of one of the cardinal problems between Israel and the Palestinians - the future of the 3 million Arab refugees - was couched in terms softer than at any time in the past. 
	
	
 The summit's declaration was the best piece of news the Middle East has produced since the Oslo Accords between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat were signed on the lawn in front of the White House in Washington in 1993. 
	
	
 The resolution that was put forward by Saudi Arabia was a plea addressed to the Israeli people over the heads of Ariel Sharon's government. No Arab leader was in any doubt that from Sharon's standpoint the resolution was not welcome. 
	
	
 The resolution forced him into a corner. Sharon neither can nor will give up the occupied territories, and so he would be unmasked in the eyes of the whole world as the man standing in the way of peace in the Middle East. 
	
	
 A few hours after the end of the summit chance came to Sharon's rescue. 
	
	
 On Thursday evening a Palestinian suicide bomber attacked a hotel in Natanya where a couple of hundred people had gathered for the traditional Passover meal. Twenty-two people were killed, in addition to the suicide bomber, and 130 were injured. 
	
	
 The bomber was a member of Hamas, the radical Muslim organization. He was known to the Israeli intelligence service. His name figured on a list that Israel had shortly before handed over to the Palestinian security service. 
	
	
 Despite Arafat's promise to take action to neutralize the people on the list, he did not lift a finger. 
	
	
 That same night the Israeli security cabinet met. They decided to take steps to destroy the "Palestinian terrorist structure, arrest its leaders, confiscate arms, and so on." 
	
	
 As a first step Israeli forces were sent into the main Palestinian town, Ramallah, where Arafat has his headquarters and from where the autonomous Palestinian areas are administered. 
	
	
 A few weeks previously Sharon had described Arafat as "irrelevant." Now he declared that Arafat was an "enemy." 
	
	
 He is now a prisoner in his own headquarters. The Palestinian Authority has effectively ceased to function. 
	
	
 Prior to the Natanya massacre Washington had imposed a number of limitations on Sharon. Israeli's antiterrorist operations must not bring the Palestinian Authority to collapse, Israeli forces must not reconquer the territories under the jurisdiction of the authority, and Arafat the man must not be molested. 
	
	
 This time Washington is largely keeping silent. It has not sent the usual appeals to both sides. Quite the reverse: Anonymous U.S. sources say that Washington holds Arafat responsible for the fact that U.S. mediator Anthony Zinni's endeavors to arrange a cease-fire have now foundered. 
	
	
 According to these sources, Sharon had accepted the cease-fire proposal, while Arafat hesitated. Before he had announced his agreement, the Natanya massacre and the Israeli counteraction occurred. 
	
	
 For the time being at least the United States has thus given Sharon a free hand. His problem is that he does not know what to do with it. The action that is currently taking place can at best only throw the terrorist groups off balance for a time. 
	
	
 It cannot solve the Israeli people's security problems, because the root of the terrorism is the Israeli occupation and the Israeli settlements on occupied territory. 
	
	
 The settlers, who number around 220,000 people, have taken the Israeli Government and consequently both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples hostage. 
	
	
 Sharon is a master of escalation. He demonstrated this he as defense minister during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which led to Arafat's being forced into exile in Tunis. It is likely that at present Sharon is entertaining similar thoughts and wants to create step by step a situation that will make it possible for him to rid himself of his enemy. 
	
	
 But this is a conflict without winners. Military superiority cannot solve problems that are fundamentally of a political nature. The day the Israeli tanks again leave Ramallah they will have sown the seed for new terrorist actions. 
	
	
 Terrorism thrives in an atmosphere of hate, and the Israeli occupation and the use of military force are creating the fertile soil from which future terrorists will be recruited. 
	
	
	


	
COOLUM, Australia, March 3 (AFP) -- Hopes of a breakthrough in the Commonwealth's bitter deadlock over Zimbabwe rose Sunday as Canada sought to resolve the row after African nations accused Britain of neo-colonialism. 
	
	
 Political violence in the lead up to Zimbabwe's elections next weekend again overshadowed the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) during a second day of crunch talks here. 
	
	
 Britain and Australia have abandoned their push to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth before the March 9-10 elections in face of increasingly angry opposition led by Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania. 
	
	
 But Britain still wants sanctions imposed if Commonwealth monitors find evidence of ballot rigging. 
	
	
 They believe the credibility of the Commonwealth will be severely damaged if there is no decisive action. 
	
	
 British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday that if President Robert Mugabe won and it were clear he had won by fraud, then he had no doubt Zimbabwe would be suspended. 
	
	
 "I mean, if there wasn't (suspension) in these circumstances, the Commonwealth would be badly damaged," he warned. 
	
	
 However, Zimbabwe's minister of state for information, Jonathan Mayo, accused Blair of leading a "racist" campaign against its former colony and lashed out at his attacks on Mugabe as "thoroughly disgraceful and unacceptable". 
	
	
 "What we do in Zimbabwe as an independent sovereign state is in accordance with our constitution and our laws," Moyo told reporters. 
	
	
 He also claimed the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was a British sponsored candidate. 
	
	
 Tanzania's President Benjamin Mkapa earlier told journalists in a stout and rare public defence of Mugabe, that even discussing the situation at the Coolum talks threatened the "prerogative and sovereign right of the people of Zimbabwe to make an unfettered choice of their leader and government". 
	
	
 "How does it (the Commonwealth) handle Zimbabwe? Why should it handle Zimbabwe?", Mkapa said, railing at what is being perceived as interference in another country's internal affairs. 
	
	
 But proposals involving a timetable for the imposition of post-election sanctions put forward by Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien to the leaders' retreat provided the first sign of a possible breakthrough. 
	
	
 "Everybody has agreed that nothing will be done before the elections", Chretien told reporters here Sunday, adding a communique would be issued Monday. 
	
	
 "The Canadian position was that the elections will occur a week from now and that we have observers there. We have to wait until the elections are over before concluding." 
	
	
 He said the formula proposed by Canada would include "a mechanism for a quick decision" once the results of the elections are known, but would not be drawn further. 
	
	
 It is believed that the proposal calls for a report from observers within two weeks of the elections, and a decision to be made in full on whether to impose sanctions within four weeks. 
	
	
 Mugabe has reportedly told Blair "to keep your pink nose out of our affairs," the Sun-Herald reported here Sunday. 
	
	
 "Go to hell," said Mugabe. "Our people have decided and that is what matters to us. It's not their (Britain's) right or responsibility to decide on our elections." 
	
	
 Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told Australian television Sunday there was some sympathy for Mugabe's comments among African leaders, whose countries were once part of the British empire. 
	
	
 "There is still that very strong sense that Britain and other countries (are) sometimes being neo-colonialist." 
	
	
 The 54-nation Commonwealth is one of the few organisations to have observers on the ground in Zimbabwe in the run-up to elections in which the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) led by Tsvangirai is challenging Mugabe's 22-year rule. 
	
	
 The issue has threatened to fracture the organisation along rich/poor, black/white lines, despite calls from its head, Queen Elizabeth II, in her opening address Saturday to work to bridge cultural differences. 
	
	
 Several Asian nations have privately said they would also oppose sanctions. 
	
	
 Fijian Foreign Minister Kaliopate Tavola told journalists that as a nation which has suffered Commonwealth sanctions, Fiji believed they were the wrong way to go. 
	
	
 Fiji was only readmitted to the Commonwealth in January after being expelled following the 2000 coup.
