 Herald Reporter 
	
	
 OPPOSITION youths are agitating to get guns to "shoot" President Mugabe "out of office," MDC leader, Mr Morgan Tsvangirai said in South Africa yesterday. 
	
	
 Speaking in an address to the Cape Town Press club, Mr Tsvangirai, who is on a visit to South Africa, was quoted by Reuters as saying he was having to "rein in militants keen to fight President Mugabe's rule". 
	
	
 "The first choice is to commit ourselves to the constitutional path with all its obstacles. We are saying we will not resort to any violent overthrow or to any violent means," he was quoted as having said. 
	
	
 "...You have people who are 20 years and 30 years (and) below who are asking if we can get guns and go and shoot the man out of office, but I say: Please, that is the most dangerous thing you can ever do," he said. 
	
	
 Mr Tsvangirai endorsed a United States proposal for targeted sanctions against President Mugabe and members of his Government but said full economic sanctions would be a ruinous mistake. 
	
	
 The US Congress is set to consider the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Bill, which seeks to impose sanctions on Harare. 
	
	
 Mr Tsvangirai called for international action to ensure a free and fair presidential election. 
	
	
 But he opposed any steps that could plunge the country deeper into a recession that has already pushed unemployment, inflation and interest rates above 60 percent. 
	
	
 "If sanctions are imposed on Zimbabwe, it will not survive. That is why, as MDC, we are reluctant at this stage to endorse the sanctions option. 
	
	
 "Until such time as Mugabe actually subverts the electoral process - when one goes to that extreme, international sanctions will be an option. 
	
	
 "However, we do support certain limitations on the villains of the crisis in Zimbabwe," he said. 
	
	
 Mr Tsvangirai might face charges of contravening the Law and Order Maintenance Act for allegedly threatening to violently remove President Mugabe from power last year. 
	
	
 His trial was set to start at the High Court in May but the case was referred to the High Court after he challenged the legality of LOMA in the Supreme Court. 
	
	
 The superior court has since heard State and defence arguments on the legality of the charges being laid against the opposition leader and reserved judgment. 
	
	
 If the Supreme Court rules in favour of Mr Tsvangirai, who if convicted on the charges might face life imprisonment, the Attorney General's Office will have to draw up a new charge. 
	
	
 But if the appeal fails, the matter will be referred back to the High Court for trial. 
	
	
 Charges against the MDC leader arose after he allegedly told a crowd at the party's first anniversary last year that "... Zvatichada, what we would like to tell Mugabe today is that... please go peacefully. If you don't want to go peacefully, we will remove you violently." 
	
	
 That according to the State constituted a breach of the LOMA. 
	
	
 The MDC leader also alleged that the Government was trying to provoke protests that could be used as an excuse to suspend democracy. 
	
	
 But analysts expressed concern that the MDC leader is "flirting with mercenaries in South Africa". 
	
	
 "But anyone who wants to speak the language of violence where Zimbabwe is concerned is playing with fire. Zimbabwe's performance in Mozambique, Somalia and the DRC speaks for itself. 
	
	
 "The quickest defeat of Tsvangirai and his MDC lot would come if they chose the path of violence," an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said.	


	
VIENNA, Sept 6 (AFP) - The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe agreed Thursday [6 September] to send 25 additional monitors in Macedonia, joining the 26 observers working to prevent a new Balkans war in the republic. 
	
	
 OSCE ambassadors from the organisation's 55 member states agreed to send the additional monitors after Russia lifted its objections to the beefed up presence. 
	
	
 Russia had slowed the decision, which was expected to have been announced a week before, raising concerns about their mandate in contrast with that of the NATO mission to collect weapons from ethnic Albanian rebels. 
	
	
 Macedonia has asked for more monitors, hoping they would help stop the country plunging into civil war between ethnic Albanian guerrillas and the Slav majority of the population. 
	
	
 NATO has entered Macedonia to collect weapons from the guerrillas, but its 30-day mission is due to end on September 26. That means Macedonia's stability will depend on other organisations, including the OSCE. 
	
	
 But the monitors' mandate, established in 1992, only includes surveying the security situation and the return of refugees, an OSCE official said. 
	
	
 The permanent council is still to adopt a new mandate which would make the OSCE, among others, responsible for training a new Macedonian police force, helping to organise a census and new elections, he added. 
	
	
 "In the meantime, doubling the number of monitors should help put people's minds at ease," he said. 
	
	
 The OSCE comprises 55 states in Europe, central Asia, the United States and Canada. Monitors have been present in Macedonia for some years alongside European Union observers. 
	
	
	


	
Tajikistan: drug-busting hampered by obsolete equipment 
	
	
 Text of report in English by Russian news agency Interfax 
	
	
 Moscow, 5 July: Due to poor technical equipment, Tajikistan seizes only 10 per cent of the drugs transited through its territory from Afghanistan, Director of the Tajik anti-drug agency Rustam Nazarov has said. "Since our technical equipment is far from perfect, we perhaps seize even less than 10 per cent," Nazarov said in an interview with the Thursday edition of Nezavisimaya Gazeta. Out of 2,200 kg of drugs seized this year in Tajikistan, only 837 kg were seized at the border, and the rest inside the country, Nazarov said. "Our agency seriously needs equipment for detecting drugs," he said. "We do not have special devices for inspecting large automobiles and cargoes," Nazarov said, adding that his service does not have enough communications equipment, either. 
	
	
	


	
Havana, January 12 (XINHUA) -- Cuba will not create obstacles to the U.S. decision to hold part of the Taliban and al-Qaeda war prisoners at the U.S. naval base of Guantanamo, the Cuban government said in a statement on Friday. 
	
	
 This is the first time that the Cuban government has expressed its position over the U.S. holding of the Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners in its territory. 
	
	
 Guantanamo is part of the Cuban territory, but the Cuban government will not create obstacles to the U.S. transfer of the war prisoners there, it said. 
	
	
 The Guantanamo Bay has been in U.S. hands since the Spanish- American War in 1898. The United States has refused to give up the facility, which is sealed from Cuba by a heavily guarded, 27- kilometer perimeter fence, despite Cuban objection to its continued existence. 
	
	
 In the statement, the Cuban government said the country would maintain close contacts with the U.S. military personnel in the naval base. 
	
	
 A first group of 20 war prisoners from Afghanistan arrived Friday afternoon at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo on the southeastern tip of Cuba, about 1,000 kilometers from the capital city of Havana.

 Beijing, Jan. 12 (Yonhap) -- Criminals have been increasingly preying on Korean travellers and residents in China with the increase of exchanges between the two countries since the opening of diplomatic relations in 1992. Over the past three years, 15 Koreans were murdered, 177 were assaulted, 95 kidnapped or illegally confined, and 64 robbed, the Korean Embassy in Beijing said Saturday. The figures are feared to be higher since many cases were not reported, an embassy official said. The most frequent crimes involved the loss or theft of Korean passports, according to the official. Last year alone, 1,800 Korean passports were reported missing in China -- 1,000 in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 400 in Beijing and 200 in Shanghai, the official said. Missing passports find their way to human traffickers, he said. 
	
	
 "About 90 percent of foreigners' missing passports are Korean's, and the missing passports are being used mostly for crimes like illegal entry, downgrading the nation's credibility in the international community," the official said. The number of crimes committed by Koreans has also been on the increase. Among the crimes are illegal trafficking or forgery of passports, drug production and transportation, smuggling, overstaying visas and drunk driving, the official said. Last year, 1.6 million Koreans travelled to China, up from 1.34 million in 2000, and the number of Korean students in China hit 16,000, more than any other country; Japan trailed with 15,000 students, the official said. hsj@yna.co.kr	



   Midweek: Wheel turns with a vengeance for the Taliban

 



  AS Camp X-ray in Cuba's Guantanamo Bay continues to fill with 
Muslim militants who had sworn to die rather than be captured, 
even the little we see of their situation makes it clear they're 
in hell.

  Many in the outside world are disturbed by conditions in 
"Gitmo". The United States dismisses such concerns: it's a 
prison, after all; remember the Black Hole of Mazar-iSharif.

  Anxiety arises, however, from the sense that the cultural gulf 
between these prisoners and their captors is so vast that the 
latter genuinely do not see how a diet of peanut butter and 
bagel chips can be considered cruel and inhuman punishment.

  The suffering of these particular prisoners is, indeed, 
particularly great. Their prayers are now led by a victorious 
enemy soldier - what could be worse? Quite a lot, as it happens. 
Crouched in their cages in Cuba, they must know that back in 
Afghanistan TVs are glowing, Bollywood is bellowing, men are 
shaving, women unveiling and sending their daughters to school.

  One can feel sorry for the hapless vanquished now on that limbo 
rock in the Caribbean, and hope that some might follow the 
threads of their tortured consciences back out of the labyrinth, 
having duly met and been eaten by the Minotaur.

  Still, it might be doubly difficult for the Afghans among them 
ever to go back, if the new administration of their home country 
goes ahead with rebuilding the Buddhas of Bamiyan for their 
potential as a tourist attraction.

  It's been almost a year since the Taliban blew up those 
monumental 1,500-year-old sandstone statues in northcentral 
Afghanistan, at which time the only way for the rest of us to 
handle the insult to human sensibilities was to emulate the 
Gautama Buddha himself, and profess relief.

  Those statues probably hadn't been a good likeness of him, 
anyway. His clothes probably never looked quite like that - the 
statues' fashion sense had been clearly influenced by the 
Greeks, what with Alexander the Great having passed through on 
his way to giving up with India.

  As for likenesses, the Buddha said on his deathbed: "All 
composite things arise and decline. Work out your salvation with 
diligence." So he is unlikely to have been enamoured of statues.

  Which, one supposes, was indeed the motivation of those who blew 
away those statues to leave two giant holes in the Afghan 
landscape, in the process paying unthinking tribute to some of 
the Buddha's subtlest and most profound teachings on the nature 
of impermanence and the perils of delusion.

  Besides, those statues had been defaced long before they were 
finally reduced to rubble. One of them had lost not just its 
face but its entire head. The other had a big hole in its 
crotch, at which someone had launched a rocketpropelled grenade 
back in '98.

  Judging by its demeanour, the statue hadn't felt a thing. But 
the Taliban commander who aimed that RPG was certainly ascribing 
human characteristics to a lump of stone. Which was most 
disturbing of all, because such was the very sin that rocket was 
supposedly intended to expunge.

  So those poor bullet-scarred statues made everyone look sad and 
foolish, and their final immolation a year ago put them out of 
their misery, so to speak.

  Even at the time, though, this was a stretch for even the most 
ardent apologist. The veil of compassion was hardly elastic 
enough to pull over those two great big holes in the earth.

  That was the moment at which the fabric of compassion tore, and 
worlds cracked apart; when the contrast and conflict of 
civilisational values became so great as to remove any sense of 
common ground - even on which to do battle. On both sides of the 
divide after that gratuitously destructive event, anything went. 
And did, spectacularly.

  Of all the unconscionable things the Taliban did to Afghan 
society in the six years of their reign, their demolition of the 
Buddhas of Bamiyan last March cleaved the rift between 
civilisations that was rammed wide open by hijacked aircraft 
over America just six months later, and which the US has since 
cauterised with the molten metal of its military might.

  And so it has come ironically to pass that, one year on, a new 
Afghan order is dreaming of rebuilding those statues, while 
what's left of the Taliban now sits in cells a world away, 
beardless, bald and clad in saffron.

U.S. wants Kyoto dropped from U.N. meet agenda

 



  
Tadayoshi Sakaguchi Yomiuri Shimbun Correspondent

  The United States, having pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, is 
now objecting to its implementation in 2002 being mentioned as 
one of the goals for a global environmental agenda being drawn 
up at the United Nations.

  The United States has demanded that wording on bringing the 
Kyoto Protocol on global warming into effect in 2002 be excluded 
from the implementation documentation of a global environmental 
agenda being drawn up at the third session of the preparatory 
meeting of the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED), sources said Thursday.

  The Kyoto pact grew out of the Conference of the Parties (COP) 
to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, which itself 
came out of UNCED.

  The United States has pulled out of the protocol, which obliges 
developed countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and 
announced in February a voluntary U.S. plan to slow the growth 
of global warming gasses.

  The latest move, a sign that the United States is stiffening in 
its attitude toward the pact, will likely draw the ire of other 
countries, including those in the European Union as well as 
Japan, which want an early implentation of the Kyoto protocol.

  The implementation documents, being drawn up at an 
intergovernmental meeting at U.N. headquarters in New York, are 
based on a chairman's paper announced at the second session of 
the preparatory meeting in January. It states how to implement 
Agenda 21--a U.N. global action program for environmental 
restoration, preservation and social development.

  The chairman's paper stated that the countries will do their 
best to ensure 1997 Kyoto Protocol is put into effect in 2002 to 
curb global warming. It also stated developed countries would 
give financial and technical support to those countries 
vulnerable to climate change, such as island nations, and 
alleviate the global warming's impact by introducing devices 
such as satellite observation systems to monitor rising sea 
levels.

  The U.S. government delegation, however, demanded that these 
statements in the chairman's paper be reworded to say that 
countries would tackle climate change in line with the schedule 
agreed upon at COP7 (the seventh session of COP), which mapped 
out implementation of the Kyoto Protocol at an appropriate time.

  Furthermore, concerning assistance to island countries, although 
the U.S. delegation agreed to establish satellite observation 
systems, it demanded that wording about the impact of global 
warming be deleted. The delegation said that a causal relation 
between unusual climatic phenomena and greenhouse gas emissions 
has not been proved.

  The general opinion among other developed countries, however, is 
that the scientific data is commonly interpreted as linking 
droughts, floods and rising tides to global warming.

Cabinet OK's ratification draft

  The Cabinet endorsed for Diet approval a bill for ratification 
of the Kyoto Protocol as well as a revision bill on measures to 
fight global warming. The bill was submitted to the Diet later 
that day.

  In preparation for ratification, the government has already 
adopted a framework that would achieve the protocol's target on 
greenhouse gas emissions. After the Diet ratifies the protocol, 
work will begin on cutting gas emissions.

   Geneva Convention applies to Taliban, not Al Qaeda: US

 



  WASHINGTON, Feb 7: The White House on Thursday declared that the 
Geneva Convention applies to Taliban forces in the Afghanistan 
phase of the war on terrorism, but not to Osama bin Laden's Al 
Qaeda followers.

  "President Bush today has decided that the Geneva Convention 
will apply to the Taliban detainees but not to the Al Qaeda 
international terrorists," Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer told 
reporters.

  The move comes after fevered criticism - including from key US 
allies - stemming from alleged mistreatment of Taliban and Al 
Qaeda detainees the United States is holding at "Camp X-Ray" in 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

  "It will not change their material life on a day-to-day basis: 
they will continue to be treated well because that's what the 
United States does," said Fleischer, who noted neither group 
would be granted prisoner of war status. And, "Al Qaeda is an 
international terrorist group and cannot be considered a state 
party to the Geneva Convention. Its members therefore are not 
covered," by the accord, said the spokesman.

  DETAINEES ARRIVE IN CUBA: A new group of 28 prisoners captured 
in Afghanistan arrived by air on Thursday, bringing the total 
number of detainees to 186.

  Six of the detainees were transported on stretchers aboard the 
C-141 cargo flight that left Kandahar, Afghanistan on Wednesday 
for the 25-hour flight.

  Earlier on Wednesday, the US military resumed controversial 
flights of heavily guarded Al Qaeda and Taliban captives from 
Afghanistan to a naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a senior US 
official said.

  The official, who asked not to be identified, told newsmen that 
the first flight of captives in more than two weeks had left 
Afghanistan late on Wednesday and was to arrive at the isolated 
prison camp late on Thursday. The official did not say how many 
prisoners were on the flight.

  Flights carrying up to 30 of what the Pentagon calls "detainees" 
were suspended on Jan 23 by defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld 
pending expansion of outdoor jail facilities at the American 
base.

  A total of 158 captives, whom the Pentagon has refused to 
classify as prisoners of war, are already being held and 
interrogated at Guantanamo amid criticism they have not been 
treated properly under the Geneva Convention.

  None has yet been charged with a crime, but Washington has 
maintained that the prisoners are being treated humanely.

  The shackled and blindfolded captives are being flown to Cuba 
from Kandahar in southern Afghanistan under tight guard and are 
being housed at the base in 8-by-8-foot cage-like outdoor cells.

  The detainees at "Gitmo," as US soldiers call the base, are of 
various nationalities. Saudi officials have said that 100 are 
from the Gulf kingdom and have demanded they be returned to face 
justice at home.

  Bush said last week he was willing to consider Saudi Arabia's 
request on a case-by-case basis but U.S. officials doubted it 
would happen any time soon.-AFP/Reuters

GATUNA, Rwanda, July 6 (AFP) - President Paul Kagame of Rwanda and his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni began talks here Friday in a bid to mend soured relations between their neighbouring countries. 
	
	
 The two heads of state met under an canvas awning set up for the occasion a few hundred metres (yards) from the Gatuna border post, an AFP correspondent reported. 
	
	
 The formerly close allies fell out in 1999, the year after each sent troops to back rebel movements in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, when mounting rivalry lead to violent clashes between their own armies there. 
	
	
 Museveni and Kagame have met three times since the fighting broke out in the DRC city of Kisangani, the main town in the northeast of the country, but without patching up their differences. 
	
	
 In March, Uganda declared Rwanda a hostile nation because of tensions arising from Kigali's alleged support for a rival to Museveni in a presidential election. 
	
	
 The two countries have each accused the other of backing dissidents. 
	
	
	



   US human rights report invites scorn

 


Author:     CHIDANAND RAJGHATTA - TIMES NEWS NETWORK [ TUESDAY, MARCH 05, 2002 1:21:47 PM ]

  WASHINGTON: Unprecedented scepticism and scorn accompanied the 
release by the United States on Monday of its annual human 
rights report amid charges of hypocrisy and double standards 
arising from the ongoing war on terrorism.

  Washington's kid glove treatment of its so-called allies such as 
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan came up for withering scrutiny at a 
briefing to release the 2001 Country Reports on Human Rights 
Practices, an annual administrative exercise mandated by the 
Congress that many feel has increasingly become a meaningless 
ritual.

  Amid widespread domestic criticism over curtailment of civil 
liberties, US officials laboured to convince a disbelieving 
press corps that the exercise was evenhanded. The report does 
not look at the state of human rights in the US itself because, 
in the words of one official, "that wouldn't be fair."

  The individual country reports is a compendium of alleged human 
rights violations culled from various sources, mostly the local 
media. The report on India, for instance, is more than 100 pages 
long and painstakingly lists incidents of rights violation 
across the country both by the government and terrorist, 
militant, and subversive groups.

  The human rights report exercise was originally linked to US 
foreign assistance, but increasingly many countries are taking 
it less seriously in the face of Washington glossing over the 
record of its so-called allies. While secular and democratic 
countries such as India merit a litany, a country like Saudi 
Arabia, one of the least free countries in the world, was turned 
over in 32 pages. The US has shown no inclination to punish 
allies it bankrolls such as Egypt and Turkey while berating 
countries less relevant to it.

  Critics in the media sharply questioned such duplicity at 
Monday's briefing as Lorne Cramer, US Assistant Secretary for 
Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour, struggled to defend 
American policy. Excerpts from the briefing:

  Question: Just give us a couple examples what you're doing in 
Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, Egypt.

  Assistant Secretary Craner: I'll throw out a few examples. In 
Uzbekistan, we're undertaking a programme to help a variety of 
civil society groups around the country come together to 
formulate future plans. In Kyrgyzstan, we talk about the press 
in Kyrgyzstan, and we're going to help fund an independent 
printing press there. Those are just two examples that are 
coming out of my office.

  
Q: What about Saudi Arabia?

  
Craner: We're getting there.

  Q: Lorne, I want to follow up on Saudi Arabia. I'm a little bit 
surprised by your glib answer. With the demise of the Taliban, 
there is arguably no government in the world that has as bad a 
human rights record as Saudi Arabia does. What is the United 
States doing to actively promote democracy and human rights with 
Saudi Arabia?

  Craner: Well, I would say two things. Number one, I disagree 
that it's the worst violator.

  
Q: Who is the worst violator?

  Craner: I would place Iraq and North Korea and Libya and a 
couple of other countries into that category.

  Q: You didn't answer my question. What is it that we are doing 
in Saudi Arabia to promote that greater voice and greater 
democratic participation?

  Craner: We are talking to the Saudi government about how to do 
that, and we are going to encourage others in the Muslim world, 
in the Arab world, who are trying to make their societies more 
democratic.

  Q: At what levels are we talking? I mean, there's nothing that's 
visible at all to us in the outside world.

  Craner: Okay. I would look at the last paragraph, the last 
couple paragraphs, of the President's State of the Union 
Address.

  Q: But I heard this before. I'm asking specifically about one 
country.

  
Craner: Yes. What are you asking?

  
Q: I'm asking what it is the United States is doing.

  Craner: And I think I've outlined that. We're talking to them at 
many levels about these issues in their country. We're talking 
to a lot of people across the Arab and Muslim world about these 
issues in their countries and about how they can serve as 
examples to others.

  Q: Can I go back to Robin's question on Saudi Arabia? Can you 
point to any kind of tangible things? And when you say we're 
talking to the Government of Saudi Arabia, are we talking to 
them about starting such programs up, or are we just simply 
mentioning that they have a human rights problem?

  Craner: Can I talk about tangible advances in particular 
countries? There are things I would point to. Pakistan's 
decision to eliminate the requirement that religious minorities 
be elected separately from the mainstream electoral system.

  
Q: Is that something we've talked to the Saudis about?

  
Craner: They don't have elections.

  Q: (Inaudible) before -- that previous administrations have done 
before on Saudi Arabia. We've been talking for years with the 
Saudis. What's different?

  
Craner: How do you know that?

  Q: Because other administrations told us that they've talked to 
the Saudis about human rights and democracy issues, 
participation in women's rights and all of it.

  Craner: Well, yeah, I understand. Other administrations have 
talked about these issues. I hope you're gong to see more of an 
effect from this administration.

  
Q: But what is it -- that doesn't answer the question.

  
Craner: What is different currently?

  Q: What's different from what this administration is saying to 
them than previous administrations have said to them?

  Craner: You'll have to judge by the outcome. You'll have to see 
how we do it differently.

  Q: Why can't you give us some indication? What's the big secret? 
You talk about what we're doing tangibly in every other country 
but Saudi Arabia.

  
Craner: Because I don't yet know the effect in Saudi Arabia.

   Mugabe says he is wide awake for polls

 


Author:     AP [ TUESDAY, MARCH 05, 2002 3:19:14 PM ]

  HARARE, Zimbabwe: A defiant President Robert Mugabe said his 
party had lost ground to the opposition through complacency, but 
would win this weekend's presidential elections anyway, state 
radio reported on Tuesday.

  "We are now wide awake," Mugabe said at a rally Monday. "We 
won't let the (Movement for Democratic Change) win."

  Mugabe described the opposition as "a donkey being controlled by 
the British," the former colonial power.

  The fledgling MDC won 57 of 120 elected seats in June 2000 
parliamentary elections as Mugabe's popularity plunged amid 
economic devastation and chaos.

  The U.S. State Department released a human rights report on 
Zimbabwe Monday that accused the government of extrajudicial 
killings, undermining the independence of the judiciary and 
waging a "systematic campaign of violence targeting supporters 
and potential supporters of the opposition."

  Security forces tortured opponents, ruling party militants 
abducted people, and police arrested opposition supporters who 
were themselves the victims of crimes. Freedom of the press and 
freedom of assembly were also severely restricted, the report 
said.

  In his speech on Monday, Mugabe thanked African leaders for 
refusing to buckle to pressure to suspend Zimbabwe from the 
Commonwealth of Britain and its former territories at a summit 
of the 54-nation grouping in Australia.

  Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand demanded the 
suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth to protest 
state-sponsored violence and human rights abuses against the 
opposition.

  Mugabe said the decision to defer the possible suspension until 
Commonwealth observers report back on the election was "a 
victory against Britain's attempts to introduce a new form of 
apartheid" to serve Western interests in developing countries.

  Tendai Biti, the MDC's foreign affairs spokesman, said Mugabe 
was trying to hide his policies of violence and intimidation 
behind his rift with Britain.

  "It is not a Zimbabwe-Britain crisis. Our people are being 
brutalised by fellow black Zimbabweans. This is the issue we 
would want our African brothers to have understood," he said.

  African leaders closed ranks at the Commonwealth summit out of 
fear for their own power, he said.

  "The problems of human rights and good governance are mirrored 
in their countries," Biti said.

  The state-run Herald newspaper, a government mouthpiece, said 
Tuesday British Prime Minister Tony Blair had showed personal 
arrogance, an obsession with Mugabe and "the shallowness of his 
commitment to democracy."

  The election on Saturday and Sunday presents the strongest-ever 
challenge to Mugabe's rule.

  The opposition accuses the government of using violence, 
intimidation and new security laws to cow its voters and to 
prevent it from effectively campaigning.

  Foreign diplomats based in Harare said Monday police prevented 
them from finishing a meeting on Monday with MDC leader Morgan 
Tsvangirai.

  Police declared the meeting with about 35 ambassadors and 
members of their staffs illegal under new security laws 
requiring police permission for political gatherings. Tsvangirai 
called the meeting to discuss food shortages gripping Zimbabwe 
and measures his party was considering to combat them, diplomats 
said.

  
Police had no immediate comment.

  State radio also reported Monday that three opposition lawmakers 
tried to bribe Zimbabwe's air force commander to help calm 
security forces if Mugabe were removed. Opposition officials 
said the claim was part of a government smear campaign.

  Foreign governments have pressed Mugabe to restore the rule of 
law. The president promised he would, but the violence has 
escalated, with dozens killed in February.

Club Fed And Our Invisible Troops

Club Fed And Our Invisible Troops 
By David H. Hackworth

  The brouhaha created by breast-beating human-rights groups over 
our military's treatment of the terrorist scuzz now vacationing 
at the Pentagon's recently opened Cuban Club Fed - eagerly aided 
and abetted by a press too prone to the sensational - is 
something else. These bleeding hearts claim we're brutalizing 
the captives by forcing them to wear orange jumpsuits, sleep on 
mats, exercise daily, shower frequently and eat special food.

  My buddy, a Connecticut cop, finds the protests fascinating. He 
says, "I'm having a lot of trouble concentrating on my job 
because of the prisoners at Guantanamo."

  Then, with a twinkle in his eyes, he adds: "Are they getting 
enough sleep, the right diet, enough prayer time? We have to 
keep them happy and healthy. They only want to murder all of us 
the first chance they get."

  Amen. Their perp pal responsible for the first World Trade 
Center attack jabbed a sharpened comb into a guard's eye while 
he was in the pokey. This time around, they've already bitten 
one of the soldiers guarding them and threatened to kill anybody 
else who gets too close. After all, these are the folks who 
spent their leisure time back in Afghanistan skinning captives 
alive - when they weren't playing soccer with their heads.

  
Think of them as kamikaze killers looking for an edge.

  However you want to categorize these creeps - who are living a 
lot better at Club Fed than they ever did in the caves of Tora 
Bora - Geneva Convention rules are for uniformed soldiers, not 
for skyjackers who fly commercial planes filled with moms and 
dads into office buildings manned by civilians operating 
computers, or for zealots who kill Arab women because they drive 
a car or don't cover their faces. Al-Qaeda is a terrorist 
organization, not a state, and its crazies wear street gear and 
operate disguised as civilians. Terrorists dressed to pass like 
these were often shot right on the spot during World War II and 
the Korean War.

  I'm personally offended that none of the whistle-blowers seems 
to give a damn about the welfare or safety of our sons and 
daughters guarding these thugs. Have you read any stories about 
the dangers they face? Have any of our politicians bothered to 
inspect our kids' living conditions when they've jetted into 
Gitmo to check out the terrorists' treatment and pick up some 
tube time?

  Had anyone checked, they would have discovered that our U.S. 
Army Military Police guarding the terrorists think the prisoners 
are being treated a lot better than they are. They're not 
pleased that the brass, the lawmakers and the press are more 
interested in the well-being of the detainees than the soldiers 
guarding them, and that they might as well be invisible.

  Here's what our soldiers from the Army's 401st MP Company out of 
Fort Hood, Texas, who are the main monster-watchers, are saying:

  "We live like crap down here with no extra pay or tax break, and 
we feel that no one up above gives a rat's ass about us," a 
sergeant says. "Our officers are more concerned with doing 
Pentagon damage control concerning the detainees than looking 
after the troops."

  "The detainees sleep on soft mats on a nice surfaced floor while 
we sleep on cots inside tents with dirt floors. They get four 
hot meals a day, fresh fruit, regular issues of snacks such as 
sunflower seeds, regular clean clothes laundered by the Marine 
supply system," says another soldier. "We get canned food and 
MREs, canned fruit. We buy our own snacks and do our own 
laundry."

  "The Marine general here says we can have a beer when off duty, 
but our Army leadership is running so scared that it set a 
no-drinking policy," says another troop. "We are responsible 
enough to secure the prisoners, but not enough to have a beer."

  "The Red Cross put us in a very dangerous situation with their 
demands, and sadly our leadership went along with it," a soldier 
said. "We've been told to lie to Marine inspectors over 
standards and requirements. The Marines are right, the Army's 
wrong, and we're stuck in the middle."

  Maybe someday, do-gooders, editors, lawmakers and senior Army 
leaders will remember our soldiers are human beings with human 
rights, too, and get their side of the story. Charity should 
begin at home.


Navy Officer Balances Religious Responsibilities

Navy Officer Balances Religious Responsibilities 
By Carol Rosenberg 

  GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba -- You're the first-ever 
American Muslim cleric to minister to a prison camp full of 
suspected terrorists and one confides he has a weapon.

  
Do you keep the secret?

  
Or do you breach religious confidentiality?

  If you're U.S. Navy Lt. Abuhena Mohammad Saiful-Islam you search 
for a third way to resolve the clear conflict of interest 
between the crescent moon pin stuck in your left lapel and the 
lieutenant's bars on the right side of your uniform.

  ``I will say, `Give it to me,' -- and not tell the general who 
had it,'' he says softly but firmly. ``I'll make sure that he 
doesn't have it.''

  A 39-year-old life-long, practicing Muslim, the soft-spoken 
Bangladesh immigrant is navigating uncharted waters and juggling 
complicated loyalties -- all while managing an international 
spotlight he has never experienced before.

  As a U.S. military chaplain, his contacts with prisoners are 
governed by the same confidentiality as that of a priest, 
minister or rabbi in the clergy corps. Saiful-Islam is by 
training an imam, or a prayer leader, who guides the faithful in 
a mosque during the five-times-a-day Muslim prayer.

  At Camp X-ray, he is also serving the function of a muezzin, the 
person who announces the call to prayer, commonly from a tower 
called a minaret. In his case, he is using a public address 
system and recording the prayer for five-times-a-day broadcast.

  Sometimes he laughs uncomfortably when questioned by 
journalists. Sometimes he looks bewildered. But mostly he's a 
busy man, trying to soothe Muslim sensitivities over the rugged 
chain-linked-fence cells at Camp X-ray.

  
Advocate

  Saiful-Islam arrived at the detention center for suspected 
terrorists on Jan. 24 and made his debut by chanting the 
pre-dawn call to prayer to wake up alleged leaders of 
Afghanistan's Taliban militia and members of Osama bin Laden's 
al Qaeda network.

  Since then, he has emerged as their advocate, arguing that the 
U.S. military can safeguard its soldiers while adding a few 
amenities of everyday Islamic life.

  Soon, he says, traditional white knit skullcaps will arrive for 
the captives to top off their fluorescent orange jumpsuits.

  Saiful-Islam has also asked for some copies of the Koran, in 
Urdu, a language of Afghanistan and Pakistan, plus large-type, 
Arabic copies for those with bad eyesight or those who read like 
elementary school children.

  ``These things are hard to find in America, and Gitmo is far, 
far away,'' says Saiful-Islam, a husband and father of a nearly 
2-year-old daughter in California.

  Until he emerged as the chaplain of choice for this special 
assignment from among only 14 Muslim clerics in the U.S. armed 
forces, he was the only cleric specifically assigned to a Marine 
Corps base -- at Camp Pendleton, Calif.

  Military recruiters building a Muslim chaplains corps spotted 
Saiful-Islam in 1993, while he was an enlisted man working as a 
payroll clerk in the Pentagon and studying part-time to become a 
Muslim cleric.

  He was commissioned as an officer in 1998, just a year after 
obtaining U.S. citizenship and nine years after leaving his 
homeland to study in America.

  The first time he was sent to a theater of combat came in 
October when he served as chaplain at Operation Brightstar, a 
huge military exercise in Egypt not far from the World War II 
battleground called al-Alamein.

  
No Answers

  His role has a curious juxtaposition, which he sums up simply. 
Captives at Camp X-ray are entitled to spiritual solace, he 
says, even though he doesn't accept radical interpretations that 
have led them to an unorthodox battlefield against the so-called 
Great Satan, the United States.

  ``I, of course, don't agree with their cause,'' he says, ``and 
neither does the religion, Islam.''

  But after several days of four- and five-hour shifts inside the 
camp, hearing the prisoners' requests, he said exchanges have 
not dipped that deeply into the doctrinal.

  
Mostly, they ask about their fate, and when they might go home.

  
``I don't have any answer for them,'' he says.

  Conversations between the cleric and the captives have taken 
place, one on one, in his native Bengali and Urdu. Others 
require the services of Arabic interpreters -- who, like 
Saiful-Islam, are U.S. military men in battle dress uniforms.

  So far no one has asked him how a practicing Muslim can also 
wear the uniform of the U.S. armed forces. It was a question he 
had expected. But instead, he says with surprise, ``They all 
want to speak with me. They all raise their hands'' to catch the 
attention of the U.S. government's designated spiritual leader.

  ``If they don't trust me with their needs, they don't get it,'' 
he says, with a sigh. ``I wish I had more time.''


Many fear violence after Zimbabwe vote

 



  HARARE, Zimbabwe Wellington Chinyama sat down in a barber's 
chair, unfolded his newspaper and without glancing up asked the 
young man trimming his hair the question that seems to be on 
virtually everyone's mind here: "So Joseph, have you prepared 
yourself for Zimbabwe's civil war?"

  As Zimbabweans go to the polls this weekend to re-elect or oust 
Robert Mugabe, the only leader the country has ever known, the 
question of who will win the election seems almost secondary to 
how the loser and his followers will respond.

  Surveys show the challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, a trade union 
leader, ahead of Mugabe. But a surge in political violence and 
accusations that the governing party changed election laws to 
rig the vote have fanned widespread concerns among Zimbabweans, 
election monitors and foreign diplomats that neither political 
party nor their supporters are prepared to accept the final 
tally.

  "It does not take a vivid imagination to envision a scenario on 
the ground where either rioters or the military take to the 
streets in the days to come," an African diplomat said.

  Most disturbing are pronouncements by senior government 
officials and military leaders that they would not allow this 
former British colony to be led by Tsvangirai and his political 
party, the Movement for Democratic Change. In a television 
interview broadcast the other day, Didymus Mutasa, a spokesman 
for Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party, said that he and other 
veterans of the country's independence war found the prospect of 
a Tsvangirai government intolerable.

  "People have said being ruled by the MDC is being ruled by Ian 
Smith," Mutasa said, referring to the prime minister of 
white-ruled Rhodesia, as the country was known before gaining 
independence in 1980. "Under these circumstances, if there were 
to be a coup, we would support it very definitely."

  At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, 
almost all of them supporters of the Movement for Democratic 
Change. State Department officials this week accused Mugabe's 
government of numerous human rights violations during the 
election campaign, an allegation vehemently denied by ZANU-PF 
officials.

  A newspaper reported that Mugabe had put the armed forces on 
"high alert" and had recalled soldiers from neighboring Congo, 
where they have been deployed in that country's civil war. 
Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri denied the reports.

  Many Zimbabweans see this weekend's election as a contest 
between immovable forces: a 78-year-old autocrat desperate to 
remain in power and an opposition party dominated by restless 
young citizens weary of government corruption, food shortages 
and unemployment.

  "If Mugabe announces that he has won the election, I think that 
people will not believe it and will storm the castle," said 
Sibongile Mbuyiso, an opposition supporter. "But if the MDC 
wins, I believe Mugabe will announce martial law, throw 
Tsvangirai in jail for plotting to kill him and send the army 
into the streets."

  Government officials last month charged Tsvangirai and two other 
officials of his party with high treason for allegedly plotting 
to assassinate Mugabe. That charge is based largely on a heavily 
edited videotape in which Tsvangirai refers to the "elimination" 
of Mugabe.

  Tsvangirai was responding to a question posed by a Canadian 
publicist with whom he was meeting and who subsequently signed a 
contract with ZANU-PF. Political analysts say the charges may 
have laid the groundwork for Mugabe to jail Tsvangirai as a 
last-ditch effort to stay in power should he lose the election.

  But that outcome is certainly not a foregone conclusion. 
Opposition officials say that 22 of their polling agents have 
been abducted in the past week, and a surge in violent attacks 
in swing districts could persuade enough opposition supporters 
to vote for ZANU-PF to ensure Mugabe's victory.

  In addition, governing party officials have revised election 
laws and procedures in a manner that could change the outcome of 
the vote, according to independent election observers.

  ZANU-PF officials have told election observers that they intend 
to increase the number of polling stations in rural areas 
believed to be their strongholds and reduce the number of 
stations in urban areas, where there is strong support for the 
opposition. Observers say that could produce long voting lines 
and discourage some Tsvangirai supporters from casting ballots.

  ZANU-PF election officials also plan to use civil service 
employees to monitor the vote-counting and bar independent 
monitors from nonprofit organizations from assisting in such 
routine tasks as transporting ballot boxes to counting stations. 
A residency requirement introduced last month bans registered 
voters from casting ballots if they cannot provide leases or 
utility bills in their names. That, according to foreign 
diplomats and Tsvangirai supporters, could disenfranchise 
hundreds of thousands of young opposition supporters who live 
with their parents.

  "Clearly, Mugabe is doing everything he can to steal this 
election," said John Makumbe, a political science professor at 
the University of Zimbabwe.

  Tsvangirai said at a news conference Thursday night that if he 
won the election, he would not prosecute Mugabe. That could ease 
pressure on Mugabe to remain in power to avoid prosecution for 
his government's attack in the 1980s in Matabeleland, the home 
of the Ndebele tribe, which at the time posed the most 
significant threat to his leadership. An estimate of the number 
of people killed in the operation ranges from 10,000 to 20,000.

   Harsh detention for Afghan prisoners

 



  Taleban and al-Qaeda prisoners flown from Afghanistan to an 
American naval base in the Caribbean are being held in tough 
conditions of detention.

  A temporary detention centre called Camp X-Ray has been set up 
at the base in Guantanamo Bay, an isolated US outpost on the 
edge of Fidel Castro's Cuba.

  The prisoners are being housed in cells measuring 1.8 by 2.4 
metres (six feet by eight feet) with open, chain-link walls, a 
concrete floor and wooden roof.

  They face intense interrogation by US officials anxious to track 
down Osama Bin Laden, the alleged mastermind behind the 11 
September suicide attacks on New York and Washington.

  The US authorities have not granted the detainees 
prisoner-of-war status, meaning they are not protected by the 
Geneva Convention.

  Washington wants military tribunals to try the prisoners, and 
the cases are expected to be heard outside the US.

  As the base is located outside sovereign territory, the 
prisoners have no legal rights under the US constitution, and no 
right of appeal to federal courts.

  
'Are they kennels?'

  Jeffrey Kofman, an American journalist who has visited the base, 
said the facility was "very, very minimal".

  The cells had concrete floors, wooden roofs and wire mesh walls. 
Prisoners had a foam mat to sleep on, two towels - one for 
washing, the other to use as a prayer mat - and some form of 
chamber pot, he said.

  "It was a far more bares bones facility than frankly I expected 
to see. They say they will be holding the detainees in cells, 
but really they are cages...

  "One person said: 'Are they kennels?', to which one of the 
military staff in charge said: 'No they're not kennels, they are 
cells, and they're within the bounds of the Geneva Convention. 
What we are operating is humane treatment, but we're not 
offering comfort'."

  
International concern

  The human rights group Amnesty International voiced concern 
about the "cages" used for accommodation, saying they would 
"fall below minimum standards for humane treatment".

  The first group to arrive - 20 prisoners described by US 
military officials as "the worst elements of al-Qaeda and the 
Taleban" - wore goggles covered with tape and had their hands 
tied. Some also wore leg shackles.

  They wore surgical masks as some prisoners had tested positive 
for tuberculosis and at least one prisoner was sedated.

  They will spend most of their time separated, although they will 
be allowed out of their cells in small groups for meals, showers 
and some recreation.

  
They will be allowed to pray according to their faith.

  
Mosquitoes

  The camp gets chilly at night and there are swarms of 
mosquitoes.

  The base - known by US servicemen as "Gitmo"- is surrounded by 
mangrove swamps, salt marshes and dense bush - and the sea is 
shark-infested.

  The camp perimeters - lit up at night - has watchtowers and two 
fences topped with razor wire constantly patrolled by heavily 
armed marines.

  
At night the camp is lit up with halogen floodlights.

  Members of a movement that tried to prevent women working may be 
disconcerted to find that some of their guards are women.

  "We have no intention of making it comfortable," Marine 
Brigadier-General Michael Lehnert told Reuters news agency. "It 
will be humane."

  Hundreds of marines and military police have been flown to 
Guantanamo Bay to expand the compound to house up to 2,000 
prisoners.

  American marines landed in Guantanamo during the 
Spanish-American war in 1898, and the base was established under 
a 1903 treaty.

  After Fidel Castro led the Communists to power in Cuba in 1959, 
then US President Dwight Eisenhower refused to relinquish the 
base despite strong objections from Havana.

  Although Washington continues to pay the rent - set 100 years 
ago at 2,000 gold coins a year, and now worth about $4,000 - Mr 
Castro refuses to cash the cheques.

  Cuban Frontier Battalion troops continue to watch their US 
counterparts along the 28-kilometre fence, but tension has 
diminished since the end of the Cold War.

  
Hunt continues

  American officials have named al-Qaeda and Taleban leaders 
killed or captured as frustration grows that some senior Taleban 
figures are reportedly slipping through the net.

  Among those who have not been questioned by the US military are 
three former Taleban ministers who turned themselves into the 
new Afghan authorities - only to be allowed to return to their 
homes.

  The most important is former Justice Minister Mullah Nuruddin 
Turabi - known to be close to Taleban leader Mullah Omar - 
former Defence Minister Mullah Ubaidullah and former Industry 
Minister Mullah Saadudin.

  US officials are eager to question the three, who they believe 
may have vital clues about the whereabouts of Mullah Omar and 
Osama Bin Laden.

  The hunt continues for Bin Laden himself and Mullah Omar, who is 
believed to have escaped by motorbike as thousands of Afghan 
soldiers closed in on his suspected hideout.

  Also on the wanted list are many more of Bin Laden's top 
lieutenants who are believed to have evaded capture. They 
include Ayman al-Zawahri, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad leader who 
is Bin Laden's close adviser and personal doctor.

Argentina's Chaos Raises New Doubts on Monetary Fund

 



  WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 - The deadly riots in Argentina, the 
collapse of its government and another multibillion dollar 
bailout gone awry have raised fresh questions about the 
effectiveness of the International Monetary Fund and the 
financial policies of the United States, the fund's leading 
shareholder.

  Latin American and European government leaders today joined 
protesters in Buenos Aires, Wall Street traders and financial 
experts in putting at least part of the blame for Argentina's 
problems on the lending agency and the Clinton and Bush 
administrations.

  Some say the monetary fund showed callousness by failing to give 
new aid to Argentina early this month, as the country's economic 
program, designed with I.M.F. approval, was forcing painful 
austerity measures on its citizens. Others say the fund made the 
opposite mistake, repeatedly offering loans to Argentina despite 
indications that the country's policies had become unworkable, 
delaying the day of reckoning.

  These criticisms, even if contradictory, increase pressure on 
the I.M.F. and the Bush administration to articulate a clear 
policy toward financial rescue efforts, which often come under 
fire even when they are judged successful.

  Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill came into office publicly 
denouncing multibillion dollar bailouts, saying that either they 
fail outright or they allow foreign governments to get away with 
bad policymaking and investors to get away with bad bets.

  In practice, however, the Bush administration has yet to take a 
clear stance on such bailouts and has made international 
financial policy a low priority.

  Peru's finance minister, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, complained today 
that the fund bungled its dealings with Argentina by adopting 
inconsistent policies that were at turns passive and inflexible. 
"The fund is partly to blame for this because the fund did not 
sound the alarm in time and then took a very hard line when 
things were incredibly difficult," he told Peruvian radio.

  Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister, assailed the I.M.F. 
for abandoning a longtime client and imposing "demands that have 
been excessive or at the wrong time." The French, who like the 
United States are significant fund shareholders, have called on 
the lending agency to step up its involvement to help Argentina 
recover.

  After some hand-wringing about jeopardizing the money of 
American "plumbers and carpenters," Mr. O'Neill supported a 
multibillion loan for Argentina in August. He has also backed 
two large rescue packages for Turkey, a strategic ally that has 
faced tough financial problems.

  When Argentina's crisis worsened in recent weeks, Bush 
administration officials did not take a firm position, allowing 
the I.M.F. to make the call on withholding additional loans, 
people involved in the fund's deliberations said.

  Even the harshest critics of the I.M.F. put most of the blame 
for Argentina's current plight on a succession of governments in 
Buenos Aires. But many say the monetary fund should have called 
government officials to account sooner.

  Argentina adopted a strict fixed- currency regime and overhauled 
its banks in the early 1990's. It tamed inflation and became, 
for a spell, a glowing economic success story.

  But subsequent governments allowed spending to grow out of 
control, building up a foreign debt that became impossible to 
maintain. Argentina also fell into a deep recession four years 
ago. The government beseeched the I.M.F. for help to stay 
solvent as it tried to work through its problems.

  Backed by both the Clinton and Bush administrations, the I.M.F. 
twice came to the rescue, beginning late last year.

  The idea was to help the country defend its fixed currency, 
which had become a political touchstone, while avoiding default 
on $132 billion in foreign debt, allowing it to continue good 
relations with foreign investors.

  The terms of the aid program were wrenching. The government 
agreed to slash spending during a deep recession to increase the 
chances of making debt payments on schedule.

  "If Argentina got its core economic policies right, it would 
have avoided this problem," said Charles Calomiris, a finance 
and economics professor at Columbia University who has been 
sounding the alarm about Argentina for months. "But the I.M.F. 
and both the Clinton and Bush administrations let them stay in 
denial. They all wanted the problem to fall on someone else's 
watch."

  It is always a tough call to cut off aid, Mr. Calomiris said. 
But he argued that by delaying, the fund helped Argentina dig 
itself into a deeper hole.

  "If you do not show leadership and make it happen early, then 
you face a catastrophe," he said.

  Michael Mussa, the I.M.F.'s chief economist until last spring, 
said the fund was justified in providing aid to Argentina late 
last year.

  But he said that he disagreed with the decision by the fund and 
the Bush administration to continue the aid program in August, 
when he said the situation in Argentina had likely deteriorated 
beyond repair.

  "The fund made a mistake in not saying no in August," Mr. Mussa 
said. "The situation might have been more controllable then."

  The difficulty, of course, is that such calls are much easier to 
make in hindsight. Mr. Mussa acknowledged that even when the 
political and economic situation in Argentina was more stable, a 
move to delay debt payments or devalue the currency ran the risk 
of rattling financial markets and even causing a financial 
implosion in the region.

  In contrast, by watching Argentina wrestle with its finances 
over a period of months, financial markets anticipated the 
possibility of a default. The chances of contagion are now 
viewed as minimal.

  Moreover, it is difficult to place blame for Argentina's 
economic program squarely on the fund when much of the policy 
was designed by Argentina itself, sometimes over the objections 
of the fund's economists.

  At an August meeting at I.M.F. headquarters, fund officials told 
Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, that the country 
would be better off delaying debt payments.

  Argentina, however, was determined to pay its debts in full and 
keep its fixed currency in place, fulfilling what it viewed as a 
promise to its citizens and creditors who had been told for 
years that pesos were as good as dollars. It outlined strict 
fiscal policies that it claimed would allow it to meet its 
obligations.

  But by December, as Mr. Cavallo resorted to freezing bank 
accounts and raiding pension funds to find enough hard currency 
to make debt payments, collapse looked imminent. The fund 
decided to suspend aid for a program that appeared to have 
little chance of success.

  Though there were unique elements, Argentina's demise seems 
certain to add to the doubts about the wisdom of bailouts, 
doubts that have grown in recent years. Nearly every major 
financial rescue effort, including those in Mexico, Thailand, 
Indonesia, South Korea, Russia and Brazil, has come under 
intense scrutiny from the left and the right, albeit for widely 
varying reasons.

  Fund officials say privately that they cannot avoid financial 
bailouts altogether. The lesson of Argentina, they say, is that 
they need to find a way to say no before the people they are 
supposed to be helping take to the streets.

Bush Plan Expected to Slow, Not Halt, Gas Emission Rise

 



  President Bush is set to announce a plan today calling for 
voluntary measures to slow but not halt the growth in emissions 
of heat-trapping gases linked to global warming, White House 
officials said last night.

  The climate proposal is Mr. Bush's response to the Kyoto 
Protocol, the 1997 treaty accepted but not yet ratified by all 
other large industrialized countries, which would require cuts 
in such emissions by 2010 to well below their 1990 levels. Mr. 
Bush rejected the treaty last March, calling its targets 
arbitrary, its schedule too costly to meet and its terms, which 
are not easily applied in large developing countries, unfair.

  The program he is to announce this afternoon would slow the rate 
of growth in emissions in relation to the growth of the overall 
economy. It would use $4.6 billion in tax credits over the next 
five years to encourage companies and individuals to limit those 
emissions.

  Utilities, for example, would get incentives to build 
power-generating windmills; homeowners would get new tax credits 
for buying solar panels or more efficient cars.

  The one thing the climate policy would not do is require 
anything of anybody, sticking with the position Mr. Bush has 
held for more than a year on the climate issue: that firm limits 
on the so-called greenhouse gases would drag down the economy.

  The administration's approach, he plans to say, is based "on the 
common-sense idea that sustainable economic growth is the key to 
environmental progress - because it is growth that provides the 
resources for investment in clean technologies," according to an 
advance text.

  On another emissions issue unrelated to climate, aides said Mr. 
Bush would call today for mandatory restrictions on three other 
kinds of pollutants from power plants: mercury, sulfur dioxide 
and nitrogen oxides. In contrast to proposals by 
environmentalists and many Democrats, however, the plan would 
delay such cuts until 2010 or later.

  Last night, administration officials called the voluntary 
approach on climate the most reasonable path for the time being. 
A senior administration official did say, however, that if 
insufficient progress was being made by 2012, there could be a 
move toward some kind of limits. "If we're not making progress 
toward our goal," he said, "we will be considering a full range 
of programs."

  Some environmental groups criticized this kind of checkup, 
saying it puts off any measuring of progress until well after 
Mr. Bush is out of office.

  Under the administration's proposed target, the growth rate of 
emissions of carbon dioxide would drop nearly 18 percent by 2012 
- to 151 metric tons for each $1 million in gross domestic 
product, from the current level of 183 metric tons.

  But environmental groups sharply criticized this kind of 
yardstick, saying that it merely reflects an existing trend 
toward using energy more efficiently and adding that as long as 
the economy grows, this would not result in emissions 
reductions.

  Alluding to the date of the speech, Jennifer Morgan, the climate 
policy director for the World Wildlife Fund, called it "a 
valentine to the coal and oil industry that will allow emissions 
to increase without any time frame, eternally."

  One provision of the new climate plan would be to greatly expand 
a program encouraging businesses to monitor and report their 
emissions of greenhouse gases. Those that participate, 
voluntarily, would gain credits that might eventually be used in 
a trading scheme similar to that used for other pollution.

  White House officials said this could prompt industries to 
change behavior, the same way similar reporting requirements 
instituted in the late 1980's resulted in big cuts in releases 
of toxic chemicals.

  Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, 
a private lobbying group, criticized this approach, saying: "The 
president's global warming proposal appears to be another 
faith-based initiative: we should have faith that major 
corporations will line up to volunteer cuts in their carbon 
pollution. That approach has failed for a decade now, since the 
president's father set up the first voluntary program."

  And Myron Ebell, a climate policy expert at the Competitive 
Enterprise Institute, a private group whose free- market views 
are frequently embraced by industry, criticized the idea from 
the opposite ideological direction.

  "What looks like voluntary will actually be coercive," Mr. Ebell 
said.

  The president is leaving for Asia on Saturday and has been under 
pressure to present a climate plan before visiting Japan. Japan, 
which has avoided criticizing the administration over its 
rejection of the treaty, has been eager for a sign that Mr. Bush 
is concerned about the issue. Several experts on the treaty said 
that his decision to make the announcement now was very likely 
influenced by this situation.

  The proposed plan on nongreenhouse emissions from power plants - 
mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides - would impose 
mandatory limits but would allow companies to exceed them by 
buying credits from others that reduce pollution below required 
levels.

  There would be no similar limits on power plants' emissions of 
carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. In the face of lobbying 
from coal companies and utilities, Mr. Bush abandoned a campaign 
pledge last March to control the four plant emissions together 
and has shown no signs of reconsidering that idea.

  As hints of the emerging plan circulated in e-mail messages by 
environmental groups and conservative groups, it appeared that 
no one was particularly pleased.

  An official at an energy company that had been pressing the 
White House to revise power plant rules said the best news was 
that there was something finally on the table to discuss.

  "At least they're coming out with something," the official said. 
"It may not be what everyone wants, but it recognizes that the 
Senate is going to deal with climate on its power plant bill."

More Prisoners Detained in Guantanamo Bay Join Hunger Strike

 



  Strike Triggered by a TurbanAccording to military sources at the 
U.S. base, the hunger striker was first triggered on Wednesday 
when the guard took the turban off the detainee's head while he 
was still praying.

  The sources argued that it was against the rules of the prison 
because the turban could be used to conceal a weapon.

  Bush Criticized for Treating Detainees InhumanelyAs more inmates 
joined the hunger strike, some of them reportedly chanted 
rhythmically on Thursday. Prison officials have reportedly 
strengthened the already heavy security at the prison for 
precautions.

  The Bush administration has been under international criticism 
for not treating the detainees humanely. It recently bowed to 
international pressure to grant the Taliban prisoners the status 
of prisoner of war but still refused to cover al Qaeda prisoners 
with the same treatment.

Argentine Leader Quits as Economy Begins a Free Fall

 



  BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 20 - President Fernando de la R?signed 
today, halfway through his four-year term, swamped by violent 
protests and looting that erupted when his government failed to 
reverse a deepening economic crisis.

  The resignation letter, which was delivered to Congress late in 
the day, followed violent food riots and protests here and in 
several cities. At least five demonstrators were killed today, 
bringing the death toll to 21 since the protests began early 
Wednesday.

  The president had made a last- ditch effort to form a unity 
government today with the leading opposition party, but when 
that was rejected, he announced he would leave.

  Argentina, with widening budget deficits, is heavily indebted to 
foreign lenders and is battling to prevent more defaults. After 
a series of budget cuts and a patchwork of economic programs, 
the country lacks a coherent economic and monetary strategy, and 
has no consensus as to what should be done.

  Mr. de la R?resignation will put the country's immediate 
future in the hands of the moderate opposition party that 
controls Congress and had recently begun blocking many of the 
former president's policies.

  Ram?uerta, the president of the Senate, is to become 
Argentina's provisional president for at least 48 hours while 
the Congress decides how to prepare for new elections, which are 
likely sometime next year. Under the law, a new president should 
be installed within three months.

  But Congress can change that, and how it will play its hand will 
be largely left to opposition leaders, including a former 
president, Carlos Sa?nem, and Senator Eduardo Duhalde, who 
lost to Mr. de la R? the 1999 elections.

  Whoever takes power is expected to face the same tough choices 
that defeated the indecisive Mr. de la R?aced with recession 
and declining exports, some Wall Street analysts have predicted 
that Argentina will devalue its currency by unhinging the peso 
from its unusual one-for- one link to the dollar.

  While such a move would lower prices and spur growth by making 
the country's goods more attractive, it could also prove ruinous 
to millions of borrowers and to the nation's banking system 
because most loans in the country are repayable in dollars, not 
pesos.

  Mr. de la R?government collapsed with surprising rapidity, 
as the police fired shotguns at demonstrators in front of his 
palace, tear gas seeped into presidential offices and fires 
filled the grand boulevards and avenues of Buenos Aires with 
towers of black smoke.

  Thousands of demonstrators massed and set bonfires in front of 
the Congress and presidential palace throughout the day, until 
riot police, including some on horseback, stormed through the 
crowds this afternoon clubbing people while reinforcements fired 
water cannon and rubber bullets.

  Defiant crowds chanted "assassins, assassins, assassins," making 
the scenes of anarchy reminiscent of the turbulent days of 
military rule from 1976 to 1983. With the 5 deaths today, more 
than 1,000 demonstrators and looters were arrested. More than 50 
police officers were reported hurt in the disturbances in the 
capital alone.

  The violence today followed looting and rioting in 11 of 
Argentina's 24 provinces on Wednesday, and much damage to 
private businesses, especially food stores. Mr. de la R?eclared a state of siege for 30 days on Wednesday, giving him 
the right to suspend such Constitutional rights as freedom of 
assembly and speech, and giving him free rein to arrest at will.

  But his assumption of emergency powers appeared only to incite 
greater protests, beginning with an outpouring of thousands of 
people Wednesday night onto the streets of Buenos Aires, banging 
pots and pans and demanding Mr. de la R?resignation.

  In an attempt to save his government, Mr. de la R?4, went on 
national television on Wednesday night and apologized to the 
people for their disappointment in his administration's 
performance. He called on the opposition party, known as the 
Justicialist party, "to participate in a national unity 
government in which they can bring in their ideas and programs."

  When that call was rebuffed, Mr. de la R?ld his closest 
aides that he had no choice but to tape a televised resignation 
address.

  As soon as Nicolas Gallo, a senior personal aide to Mr. de la 
R?old reporters late this afternoon that the president had 
decided to resign, the streets began to calm. The text of the 
speech said the resignation was to "assure the peace."

  Mr. Gallo told reporters, "the president wanted to avoid more 
suffering." He said "history will judge" how Mr. de la R?
administration would be seen. "It's been a very sad day," he 
added.

  Most opposition party leaders have called for the devaluation of 
the peso and suspension of payment on the country's debts.

  They are also suggesting that business and consumer loans that 
are now valued in dollars be revalued into new peso amounts that 
would reduce the overall debt. The lower loan amounts would 
benefit individuals whose income is expected to decline by 30 
percent to 50 percent in a peso devaluation.

  This scheme is designed to help middle-class people with home 
mortgages and car loans that are currently valued in dollars.

  The losers would be bank lenders because the loans would not be 
fully repaid. Other losers could well be Argentine businesses 
that owe dollar debts abroad but collect revenue in pesos at 
home. It would take a greater number of devalued pesos to repay 
their dollar loans.

  "I believe the economy can be stabilized and grow during a 
transition government," said Governor Adolfo Rodr?ez Saa of 
San Luis Province, an influential member of the opposition.

  Mr. de la R?decline began in October 2000 with the 
resignation of his vice president, Carlos Alvarez, over the 
government's handling of charges that bribes were paid to 
opposition senators to pass a new labor law.

  Mr. de la R?ruling Alianza coalition of centrists and Social 
Democrats fractured, and his cabinet became a revolving door of 
officials and constantly changing economic policies.

  Then, in October, his coalition suffered a devastating defeat in 
legislative elections that gave the opposition control of both 
houses of Congress.

  Cabinet officials on Wednesday publicly accused the Buenos Aires 
governor, Carlos Ruckauf, a former vice president and one of the 
most powerful leaders of the opposition, of instigating the 
looting to overthrow the government.

  During an emergency meeting of the cabinet on Wednesday, 
ministers debated whether to openly confront Governor Ruckauf 
with charges of treason. Some aides to Mr. de la R?gued that 
the federal government should seize Governor Ruckauf's Buenos 
Aires provincial police force in order to control the rioting 
that surged in the working-class neighborhoods that surround the 
capital city.

  But Mr. de la R?sitated, and instead declared a state of 
siege, which failed to bring peace. Now Mr. Ruckauf is 
considered a major presidential contender.

U.S. Refuses to Recognize Mugabe Government

 



  U.S. President Bush said Wednesday that flaws in Zimbabwe's 
election will prevent the United States from recognizing the 
government's claim that incumbent Robert Mugabe was the winner.

  Bush told a news conference that the United States is consulting 
with other countries to decide how "to deal with this flawed 
election."

  Bush suspended U.S. entry privileges for Mugabe, his family or 
senior members of his government.

  He also denied entry to those who received "significant 
financial benefit" from dealings with Zimbabwean officials who 
carried out Mugabe's policies.

  U.S. officials said the administration may freeze assets of 
Zimbabwean officials involved in the alleged rigging of the 
democratic process.

  Another possibility is the banning of commercial export licenses 
of defense articles and services.

U.S. Begins First Airlift of Prisoners

 



  WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 - A C-17 Globemaster cargo plane carrying 20 
heavily guarded Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners left a Marine 
Corps base in southern Afghanistan today on its way to the 
United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the first wave 
of hundreds of detainees who will be held there.

  The Pentagon provided few details about the flight, but senior 
military officials said more than 40 specially trained military 
police officers guarded the prisoners on the flight, which was 
expected to make one stop before reaching Cuba, possibly as 
early as Friday morning.

  The prisoners, their hands and feet shackled and their heads 
covered by hoods, were loaded single file onto the plane at 
Kandahar Airport. Pentagon officials said some prisoners might 
also be sedated during the more-than-20-hour flight, but it was 
not clear whether that had happened.

  A Pentagon official said earlier this week that the United 
States did not consider the detainees prisoners of war, but that 
they were still being afforded the protections under the Geneva 
Convention guidelines.

  At Guantanamo Bay, the prisoners will be taken to a makeshift 
detention center known as Camp X- Ray, where they will be locked 
in 6- by-8-foot cages made of concrete and chain-link fence to 
await intensive interrogation and, possibly, trial before 
military tribunals.

  As workers prepared the camp in Cuba for as many as 2,000 
prisoners, search crews in Pakistan continued to comb the 
wreckage of a Marine Corps tanker plane that crashed on 
Wednesday in southwestern Pakistan. Seven marines died in the 
fiery accident.

  Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that there 
was no evidence that the crash had been caused by hostile fire.

  Pentagon officials also said today that the United States was 
preparing to send a force of more than 100 soldiers, many of 
them Special Operations forces, to the Philippines to help train 
Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf 
group.

  Though the American forces are expected to be involved initially 
in advising and training Filipino counterterrorist units, senior 
American military officials have said they could become involved 
in direct military action if the Philippine government requested 
it.

  Amnesty International issued a statement today saying that 
sedating prisoners or shackling them for an entire flight would 
violate international standards prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or 
degrading" treatment.

  Mr. Rumsfeld said today that he did not know how the prisoners 
would be restrained during the flight. But he defended the use 
of strong measures, saying the Pentagon had closely studied 
violent uprisings by Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners held in the 
northern Afghan city of Mazar- i-Sharif and in Pakistan.

  About 20 minutes after the C-17 lifted off from the base at 
Kandahar Airport, marines came under small- arms fire near one 
of the runways. No one was injured and the identify of the 
snipers remained unknown tonight, military officials said.

  Military officials also said John Walker Lindh, the American who 
was captured with Taliban forces near Mazar-i-Sharif, was not 
among the prisoners transferred today. Mr. Walker is still being 
held aboard the assault ship Bataan in the Arabian Sea, the 
officials said.

  American forces in Afghanistan were holding a total of 371 
prisoners today, including 351 at Kandahar and 19 at Bagram air 
base north of Kabul. But the number keeps rising as American 
military and intelligence officials continue interviewing 
thousands of prisoners held by anti-Taliban militias.

  Camp X-Ray has cells for about 100 detainees, and will soon be 
expanded to hold 220. During the next few months, military work 
crews will build permanent facilities for as many as 2,000 
prisoners.

  Mr. Rumsfeld declined to discuss details about the growing 
American involvement in the Philippines, where Abu Sayyaf 
guerrillas have been battling government troops in the southern 
island of Basilan. The rebels, who have been linked to Al Qaeda 
in the past, are holding two American hostages for ransom.

  But earlier this week, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. 
Wolfowitz said that American Special Operations forces might 
become involved in "direct support of Philippine military 
operations," though he added that the government seemed 
"anxious" to do the job itself.

  "There's no question that we believe that if they could clear 
the Abu Sayyaf group out of Basilan Island, that would be a 
small blow against the extended Al Qaeda network," Mr. Wolfowitz 
said.

  In November, President Bush promised to give the Philippines a 
$100 million antiterrorism aid package that would include 
weapons, training and shared intelligence. Since then, the 
United States has sent an array of equipment to the Philippine 
military, including a C-130 cargo plane, 30,000 M-16 rifles and 
8 UH- 1 Huey helicopters.

  In eastern Afghanistan, American B-1 and B-52 bombers dropped 
precision-guided weapons on the sprawling Al Qaeda training camp 
at Zhawar Kili near the Pakistan border today for the sixth time 
in just over a week.

  Senior military officials have said they are increasingly 
concerned that there are other equally sophisticated and 
well-fortified underground complexes elsewhere in Afghanistan 
that could become guerrilla bases for remnants of the Taliban 
and Al Qaeda forces.

  At the Pentagon, Mr. Bush signed a $318 billion military 
spending bill today for the 2002 fiscal year. "Today more than 
ever we also owe those in uniform the resources they need to 
maintain a very high state of readiness," Mr. Bush said. "Our 
enemies rely upon surprise and deception. They used to rely upon 
the fact that they thought we were soft. I don't think they 
think that way anymore."

Mugabe Predicts Victory in Zimbabwe's Election

 



  Zimbabwe's incumbent President Robert Mugabe Saturday predicted 
victory in the country's two- horse presidential race, saying 
that he will accept the outcome of the election because he will 
have defeated Morgan Tsvangirai of the opposition Movement for 
Democratic Change (MDC).

  Looking tired but blithesome after more than a month of daily 
election campaigns throughout the southern African country, 
Mugabe cast his vote in a weekend presidential poll, in which he 
is facing a serious challenge from his main rival Tsvangirai.

  The Zimbabwean veteran leader, who has been in power since the 
country gained independence from Britain in 1980, was 
accompanied to the polling station at a school in the poor 
suburb of Highfield in the capital Harare by family members, 
including two children.

  He told journalists after casting his ballot that he was more 
than confident of winning the election.

  "I will accept the results more than anything because I will 
have won," said Mugabe.

  He said those who thought the election process would be rigged 
were supporters of the MDC party, adding that they were 
prejudging and wanted to direct the process.

  Tension has risen sharply in Zimbabwe in recent months, after 
long and sometimes violent election campaigns. The MDC party has 
accused Mugabe of using violence and other electoral 
manipulation to rig the poll.

  While defying international pressure to back down from his 
controversial land reforms, Mugabe has said he needs a new six- 
year mandate to complete the reforms.

  Under these reforms, the Zimbabwean government has taken over 
excess and idle farms from white farmers, who own the bulk of 
the country's arable land, to resettle landless peasants.

  Nearly 500,000 people have been resettled since the beginning of 
last year.

  However, the program has drawn sharp international rebuke, 
particularly from former colonial power Britain, but Mugabe has 
vowed to press ahead with the reforms.

  The European Union imposed sanctions on Mugabe and 19 of his 
close associates last month, while the United States took the 
same move, accusing Mugabe of violating human rights and 
cracking down on the opposition, the media and judiciary.

  The controversial land reform is the pillar of Mugabe's 
electoral strategy, which political analysts say could work 
either way.

  In Mugabe's view, the March election is a new chapter in his 
long struggle against colonial rule, which he led from the early 
1960s until the country's independence.

  "We have to deliver and safeguard the most important heritage to 
the young generation - land - which was taken from our 
forefathers by force," he told a recent rally.

  Mugabe even talked about his desire to keep safeguarding 
Zimbabwe's sovereignty and land in spirit when he dies, a dream 
which the veteran leader said forced him to sacrifice a bright 
teaching career in the 1950s to lead his compatriots out of 
colonial rule.

  But that ambition would be fully tested at the ballot box this 
weekend.

Japan, U.S. Differ Over Global Warming Issues

 



  Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and visiting U.S. 
President George W. Bush differed over the Kyoto Protocol and 
how to prevent global warming but agreed to cooperate on that 
issue.

  Bush repeated his rejection of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol aimed 
atcurbing global warming, and pushed for the alternative he 
announced last week.

  Koizumi, meanwhile, called the new U.S. plan "a very 
constructive proposal," but asked for more efforts from the 
UnitedStates.

  "It is for the U.S. to decide whether to take part in the 
protocol or not, but I hope we will continue with our efforts so 
we can move in the same direction," said Koizumi, who supports 
theKyoto Protocol.

  "Both the economy and the environment can be improved 
together.We'd like to see further efforts on the part of the 
U.S.," the Japanese leader added.

  Bush rejected the Kyoto pact last March, saying that it would 
hurt U.S. economic growth.

  The U.S. president announced an alternative proposal last 
week,calling for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by 
companies in accordance with economic growth instead of 
mandatory reduction targets presented in the Kyoto pact.

  The proposal is criticized by environmentalists as ineffective 
for solving global warming and warn that under the plan U.S. 
greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise.

  In Monday's summit talks, Bush and Koizumi agreed to cooperate 
together with other countries, including developing nations, on 
the issue of global warming.

  Japan and the U.S. can cooperate over the development of new 
technologies in the field and that such technologies will help 
notonly the environment but also economic development, they 
agreed.

Taiwan Caucus a US Provocation: Commentary

 



  On April 9, the 23rd anniversary of the United States ' 
troublemaking Taiwan Relations Act, the US Congress is due to 
unveil a 70-member Taiwan caucus.

  Most congressional caucuses are issue-based or for particular 
racial groups but this one will be devoted solely to Taiwan, an 
inalienable part of China.

  It is claimed that the caucus will serve as an official channel 
for legislators from both the United States and the island to 
exchange ideas.

  Such a provocative move will obviously overshadow the renewed 
Sino-US relations. On a more dangerous level, it may provide 
fodder to Taiwan's military forces and play into the hands of 
Taiwan separatist extremists.

  One of the group's goals is to promote US military ties with 
Taiwan.

  This comes at a time when there have been conspicuous signs of 
ever-increasing US-Taiwan military ties.

  In mid-March, the US side granted Taiwan "Defence Minister" Tang 
Yiau-ming a visa so he could attend a conference sponsored by US 
military contractors in Florida. On the sidelines of the 
conference, he met senior Bush administration officials 
including Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and Assistant 
Secretary of State James Kelly.

  On March 22, Admiral Dennis Blair, commander-in-chief of the US 
Pacific Command, told the House Armed Services Committee that 
the United States and Taiwan can maintain a military balance 
across the Taiwan Straits if both sides continue modernizing 
their armed forces.

  It seems that this so-called military balance is what Taiwan 
leader Chen Shui-bian wants.

  Last Wednesday when receiving a special delegation from the US 
House of Representatives, Chen said that the strong support of 
the US Congress - which led to US arms sales to Taiwan in April 
last year - ensured a balanced cross-Straits military situation 
and peace in the Taiwan Straits.

  "President Bush reaffirmed the US promises to all Taiwanese and 
repeatedly declared he would abide by the Taiwan Relations Act - 
to provide Taiwan with the necessary protection against 
Beijing," Chen was quoted by the Taipei Times as saying.

  
In most cases, those who sow the wind will reap a whirlwind.

  The robust military build-up may not bring the so-called balance 
but menace instead cross-Straits peace and stability.

  Helping Taiwan build its military muscle will only foment 
pro-independence forces. Since the latest remarks and events may 
give these forces the impression that the United States is on 
their side and ready to provide military protection, they may 
become provocative enough to push the island to the edge.

Venezuela's Chief Forced to Resign; Civilian Installed

 



  CARACAS, Venezuela, April 12 - A transitional government headed 
by a leading businessman replaced President Hugo Chavez today, 
hours after military officers forced him to resign. It was a 
sudden end to the turbulent three-year reign of a mercurial 
strongman elected on promises to distance his country from the 
United States while uprooting Venezuela's old social order.

  Mr. Chavez, 47, a firebrand populist who had said he would 
remake Venezuela to benefit the poor, was obligated to resign in 
a meeting with three military officers about 3 a.m. today after 
large street protests on Thursday in which at least 14 people 
were killed by gunmen identified as his supporters.

  Early this morning, Mr. Chavez, in military fatigues and the 
trademark red beret of his left-leaning movement, was driven off 
to the Fort Tiuna army base in Caracas, where he was reported to 
be in custody.

  Pedro Carmona Estanga, the head of Venezuela's most important 
business association, was installed as interim president at a 
ceremony at 6 p.m. He promised that the new government would 
adhere to "a pluralistic vision, democratic, civil and ensuring 
the implementation of the law, the state of law."

  
Elections will be held within a year, officials said.

  The Bush administration laid the blame for Mr. Chavez's 
overthrow firmly with the ousted leader. Officials portrayed the 
ouster as a victory for democracy, even though Mr. Chavez was a 
legitimately elected president.

  "We know that the action encouraged by the Chavez government 
provoked this crisis," said Ari Fleischer, the White House 
spokesman. The Chavez government, he added, suppressed a 
peaceful demonstration and fired on unarmed protesters.

  However, Latin American leaders at a summit meeting in Costa 
Rica criticized Mr. Chavez's ouster as an "interruption of the 
constitutional order."

  A former army paratrooper who won office in 1998, Mr. Chavez 
presided over a stormy era when he seized control of the 
legislature, confronted the old-line political elite and steered 
the country into an alliance with Cuba.

  Mr. Carmona, the president of Fedeca-iras, a business 
association, said early today that Mr. Chavez had "presented his 
resignation." He spoke flanked by military officers who had 
rebelled against Mr. Chavez on Thursday night, the third day of 
a general strike called by his opponents.

  On the streets of this sprawling capital, opponents of the 
government took to the streets in the early morning hours, 
honking horns and waving the gold, blue and red of the 
Venezuelan flag. El Universal, a leading newspaper here, hailed 
the end with these words, "It's over!"

  The interim government quickly moved to undo Mr. Chavez's 
policies, dissolving the National Assembly controlled by his 
supporters, firing members of the Supreme Court and changing the 
country's official name back to the Republic of Venezuela. Mr. 
Chavez had renamed the country the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela.

  In addition, the interim government repealed 49 economic laws 
passed by the Chavez-controlled National Assembly last year, 
legislation that business leaders feared would damage the 
economy.

  While pledging to hold presidential elections within 365 days, 
officials said that Mr. Carmona, who had been a leader in the 
protest movement against Mr. Chavez, will not be able to run.

  Mr. Carmona named new ministers, including two active-duty 
military officers who rebelled against Mr. Chavez on Thursday 
night. He also named retired Brig. Gen. Guaicaipuro Lameda to 
head Petr?s de Venezuela, the huge state-owned oil company, 
which exports most of its oil to the United States.

  Mr. Chavez had fired Mr. Lameda in February and appointed a 
left-leaning ally in his place along with five board members 
close to his government, enraging thousands of office workers at 
the company.

  Mr. Carmona said that operations would return to normal at the 
oil company. It had been crippled when office and production 
workers began staging work slowdowns last week in protest.

  "Venezuelan society has reached a consensus to find a way 
forward, a way that necessitated a transitional government that 
guarantees the reestablishment of democracy," Mr. Carmona told 
reporters

  Mr. Carmona said that the transitional government was being 
formed with "the consensus of civil society and also from the 
military."

  Cuba called the change-over a coup and urged other countries to 
distance themselves from the new government. President Fidel 
Castro and Mr. Chavez had formed a close friendship.

  The interim government today ended Mr. Chavez's policy of 
offering oil to Cuba under terms favorable to Havana.

  Mr. Chavez's daughter, Mar?Gabriela, speaking in an interview 
on state television in Cuba, said that her father had not 
resigned. In a phone conversation Friday morning, just before he 
fell from power, he told her, "I am a jailed president," she 
said.

  The attorney general, Isa? Rodr?ez, also said Mr. Chavez had 
not resigned, but was forced out by military officers.

  President Vicente Fox of Mexico took a strong stand, saying his 
country would not recognize Venezuela's new government until 
elections were held. Diplomatic relations between the two 
countries, however, would continue.

  American officials praised the Venezuelan military and the 
police for defying Mr. Chavez, as well as television stations 
and other media outlets that continued to function despite 
government orders to shut down.

  "We wish to express our solidarity with the Venezuelan people 
and look forward to working with all democratic forces in 
Venezuela to ensure the full exercise of democratic rights," 
said Philip T. Reeker, a State Department spokesman.

  For now, the government focused on clearing up the events 
leading to the violence of Thursday afternoon, remembering the 
fallen and searching for those who were responsible. Mr. 
Chavez's interior minister, Ram?odr?ez Chac? was taken 
into custody, and the police were looking for a strong Chavez 
supporter, Freddy Bernal, the mayor of a district of Caracas.

  Security forces, meanwhile, searched the homes of members of the 
Bolivarian Circles, neighborhood groups that were formed by Mr. 
Chavez's government and that were accused by the interim 
government of responsibility in the shootings.

  Television broadcasts on Thursday showed several men in 
plainclothes firing semiautomatic handguns from a bridge over a 
busy street in downtown Caracas. Among the crowd of assailants 
were people in red berets and T-shirts bearing the name of Mr. 
Chavez's movement.

  Mr. Carmona said that "justice must be done" for the families of 
those killed. He promised that they would receive government 
benefits.

  Among Mr. Carmona's most pressing tasks now will be to assuage 
concerns in other countries about how Mr. Chavez's reign ended 
and deal with the polarization between rich and poor that 
divides this country, analysts familiar with Venezuela said.

  "The goal for his successors is to effectively tackle the 
pressing socio-economic issues that brought Chavez to power with 
so much popular support," said Russell Crandall, a Latin America 
specialist at Davidson College in North Carolina. "Chavez was 
right about the problems he saw in Venezuela. He was wrong about 
the solutions and the Venezuelan people made that very clear."

Blair not happy with new green deal

 



  The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, disagreed yesterday with 
Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the 
United States.

  The Federal Government denied that the agreement, signed this 
week, was a signal it was dumping the Kyoto Protocol on 
greenhouse gases.

  The Australian-US "climate action partnership" involves liaison 
between governments, businesses and research bodies on climate 
change.

  Critics say that on the one hand Australia is saying it does not 
want to dump Kyoto, yet on the other it is cosying up to the US 
- which does want to dump Kyoto.

  Australia's involvement in Kyoto has been in doubt ever since 
the US President, George Bush, announced last year that 
ratifying the protocol would hurt the US economy.

  The future of the protocol, which sets targets for all countries 
in an attempt to cut pollution, will be decided this year at a 
meeting in Johannesburg.

  A spokeswoman for the Environment Minister, David Kemp, said 
yesterday that the minister was on his way to talks with the 
European Union in Brussels after a formal visit to Washington, 
and that the Government was still committed to Kyoto.

  The Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, said 
yesterday that Australia "should not follow the US position on 
climate change".

  Mr Blair told the ABC that greenhouse gases were an area where 
there was an obvious disagreement with the US.

  Asked if the disagreement was also with Australia, Mr Blair 
said: "Yes. But I simply say to people, it is for individual 
countries to state their own position."

  
He was not sure the Kyoto Protocol actually went far enough.

  "The more I read about climate change, the more concerned I 
become about this issue."

   Zimbabwe vote a test of patience

 



  HARARE AND RUSHINGA, ZIMBABWE - Martha's neighbors know her as a 
high-ranking district official of Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF 
Party, the woman who drills local children each Friday in the 
party doctrine. But in her heart, the 38-year-old widow supports 
the opposition and keeps a Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) 
membership card hidden in a cooking pot.

  "We just want someone who can give us food, hospitals, school 
fees. A better life," says Martha, explaining why she voted for 
MDC candidate Morgan Tsvangirai.

  There are many Marthas here, people who marched to ZANU-PF 
anthems and cheered President Robert Mugabe at rallies, while 
secretly planning to vote for Mr. Tsvangirai. "People pretend to 
be ZANU-PF because they are afraid. They wear the T-shirts and 
go to the rallies, but inside, they don't believe," she says.

  After months of fear and intimidation, Zimbabweans streamed to 
the polls this weekend in record numbers to cast their votes in 
the country's first contested election since independence 22 
years ago. Many arrived at overburdened polling stations in the 
early hours of the morning and waited in the hot sun for the 
entire day without food.

  "You see this tarred road and this grass? That was my bed," says 
Janet, a Harare secretary, who waited for more than 27 hours at 
a polling station in the impoverished Harare suburb of 
Kuwadzana. "I wanted to go home, but I have to vote," she says. 
"This is a crucial presidential election. This is our future."

  Even as voters went to the polls over the weekend, the 
intimidation and attempts at rigging continued. The government 
slashed the number of polling stations in urban areas where the 
MDC is favored, while boosting the number in rural ruling-party 
strongholds. In Kuwadzana, there were seven polling stations for 
about 55,000 people. Rural Bindura had 41 polling stations for a 
smaller number of people.

  Now the country's 5.6 million voters are waiting anxiously for 
the results of the poll to be announced, although the voting, 
which was supposed to end Sunday, may stretch on for days. The 
question foremost in the minds of most Zimbabweans is whether 
attempts to rig the election through voter intimidation, last- 
minute election-law changes, and outright fraud have succeeded.

  An increasing number of local election monitors and 
international observers say the vote rigging has been so 
thorough that hopes for a free election are dead.

  "The main cheating took place long before election days," says 
Brian Murphy of the Zimbabwe Citizens support group, an 
organization whose members spread around the country this 
weekend privately monitoring the elections. Mr. Murphy points to 
the lack of independent voter education, the lack of any 
independent radio stations, and the ban on holding opposition 
rallies in many districts as just a few examples. "This is not a 
fair election," he says.

  
There is a deep faith here, however, in the power of democracy.

  Edward Murchabaiw arrived at a Rushinga polling station at 6 
a.m. in a wheelbarrow, his emaciated frame drowing in a faded 
blue suit-jacket. Murchabaiw, diagnosed in the last stages of 
AIDS, does not believe he will live to see the results of this 
election. But he wanted to sound his voice. "I am happy now," he 
says with a bright smile after voting. "I have made a 
difference."

  In urban areas, lines snaked for more than a mile and angry 
voters sometimes tried to push their way into polling booths. 
Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at one restless crowd, 
injuring at least 12 people. Some polls stayed open all night, 
with people voting by flickering candlelight or under harsh 
fluorescent bulbs.

  "The intention, of course, is that you frustrate as many voters 
as you can. Mugabe is trying to move the goal posts to 
disenfranchise people, these people he thinks will vote against 
him," said Tsvangirai, visiting one polling station where 
thousands waited angrily to cast their votes, waving their hands 
in the open-handed signal of the MDC.

  In rural areas, many polling stations stood empty by midday. 
Lines were not a problem, but transparency was.

  The MDC says that 52 percent of its rural polling agents were 
chased away, abducted, or refused accreditation by government 
officials, leaving the voting process open to widespread abuse. 
Old and illiterate voters were assisted by ZANU-PF officials who 
often directed them to vote for the incumbent president.

  At the Chaparandza Primary School in the rural Rushinga, Mary 
Mugumira, wearing a wool "USA 1997" hat, a long traditional 
dress, no shoes, and a confused look, asked the presiding 
officer to vote for her. He refused, but sent her to talk to the 
election officers - both of whom represented the ruling ZANU-PF 
party. A moment later she had decided, and the polling agent, 
smiling, put an "X" mark on the ballot in the space marked 
"Robert Mugabe, ZANU-PF."

  Despite everything, there is still hope in Zimbabwe that this 
election may bring change.

  "I am happy because I finally got to vote," says a jubilant 
Colin Chipepera, after waiting for more than 12 hours in one 
Harare voting line. "I think this is the final nail on the 
government's coffin. Even with all their tricks, there are too 
many of us."

   Not 'gonna be a long, long time' till you can be a rocket man

 



  The International Space Station is not exactly the 
Waldorf-Astoria. And a Russian Soyuz capsule will never boast 
the creature comforts of a stretch limo.

  But that doesn't bother an increasing number of well-heeled 
executives and celebrities willing to pay millions of dollars 
and spend a few months training in exchange for a quick trip to 
orbit.

  Welcome to the dawn of space tourism, where opportunities to 
view spaceship Earth from aboveare rare, visions of the future 
are grand, and Everyman seems willing to shed planet Earth, if 
briefly. The latest "tour-o-naut" to buckle up and place his 
tray table in the upright, locked position is South African 
venture capitalist Mark Shuttleworth. He launched with two 
cosmonauts on a space-station resupply flight yesterday from the 
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. He is the second fare-paying 
visitor to the station, following in the bootsteps of Dennis 
Tito, a US businessman who took that same trip last year.

  They aren't alone. "Another eight to 10 people have expressed 
interest" in a Soyuz trip to the space station, notes Tereza 
Predescu of Space Adventures, an Arlington, Va., company that 
arranges the flights.

  
'N space?

  Russia's next resupply flight is scheduled for October, and two 
Americans are vying for the passenger seat: former National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration associate administrator 
Lori Garver and boy-band 'N Sync's Lance Bass. Aerosmith rocker 
Steven Tyler also is reportedly eyeing a future flight.

  "There is a lot of pent-up demand, at least emotionally" among a 
large number of people to journey into space, says John Logsdon, 
of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University in 
Washington, D.C.

  For example, in 2000, Harris Interactive surveyed Americans' and 
Canadians' willingness to travel into space as tourists. 
Overall, 86 percent of the 2,022 respondents would be interested 
in a trip to space. Extrapolating from the results, Space 
Adventures, which commissioned the study, estimates that 10,000 
people a year would be willing to pay $100,000 apiece for a 
quick up-and-down suborbital flight, a la Mercury astronaut Alan 
Shepard. That translates into a $1 billion-a-year business.

  If they received the trip as a promotion or gift, 80 percent of 
the respondents said they'd take an intercontinental 
space-plane, 70 percent would take a space-station tour or an 
orbital flight, and 74 percent would be willing to take a 
suborbital journey.

  For space tourism to truly take off, however, several things 
must happen, says Frank Sietzen of the Space Transportation 
Association, an aerospace-industry group in Arlington, Va.

  "You need a strong, growing US space transportation system, and 
the federal ... decision that it's in the national interest to 
fund ... a second generation reusable launch vehicle to supplant 
the shuttle at a sufficiently low cost that it would be 
commercially viable," he says. Out of that effort would come the 
rocket or rockets that would service commercial passenger 
flights.

  He likens the effort needed to one the US Air Force undertook in 
1951, when it began developing an aerial tanker to refuel jet 
fighters and bombers. The result, he continues, was the KC-135, 
known commercially as the Boeing 707, the first commercial jet 
to be used worldwide.

  The government is moving in that direction with NASA's Space 
Launch Initiative. The agency has budgeted $4.8 billion through 
2006 for the development of safer, more reliable, and cheaper 
follow-ons to the shuttle. It looking beyond the SLI to a 
program designed to develop a third-generation of launch 
vehicles.

  Others are not waiting for the government to act. Some 20 
companies and groups worldwide are in a competition for a $10 
million purse offered to the first firm that can build and fly a 
two-stage, reusable rocket that can carry three people on a 
suborbital flight and be refurbished for its next flight within 
two weeks. Yesterday, a Canadian team paraded a mockup a 
60-foot-long "Canadian Arrow" through the streets of Manhattan 
in a pitch coinciding with Mr. Shuttleworth's launch.

  Known as the X Prize, the contest is modeled after the prizes 
that stimulated growth of commercial aviation early in the last 
century, says X Prize Foundation president Peter Diamandis.

  
Modern barnstormers

  Noting that Charles Lindbergh's record-breaking trans-Atlantic 
solo flight was a response to the offer of an aviation prize, he 
adds that within six years of that flight, commercial passenger 
flights became common. He expects a similar commercial response 
after his prize is issued.

  "People paid what for them were large sums of money" to fly with 
early-20th century barnstormers "to see the world from 2,000 
feet," he says. He expects a similar response when an X Prize 
winner emerges. Indeed, Space Adventures already has payments 
from roughly 100 customers willing to fly with astronautical 
barnstormers once a winner emerges, perhaps as early as 2004 or 
2005.

  The contest already is stimulating a range of related efforts, 
ranging from states trying to set up space ports for tourism 
flights, to Federal Aviation Administration development of 
licensing requirements for private commercial launch facilities 
and passenger operations.

  Where Dr. Diamandis sees relatively short-term opportunity, 
however, others suggest a viable space-tourism industry is still 
a decade or more away. "It will happen," he says, "but not in 
the time frame that will please tourism's advocates."

   Veni, Vidi, Venezuela

 



  FIGHTING tyranny with tyranny clearly didn't work in oil-giant 
Venezuela last week. And now coup-plotting military officers and 
the reinstalled president, Hugo Chavez, need to show Latin 
America that their tyrannical tactics are at an end.

  President Chavez - a former Army coup-meister himself, who was 
elected three years ago - has abused his popular mandate with 
heavy-handed measures based on a Constitution largely rewritten 
by himself and his supporters. He has sometimes talked of 
remaining president past the year 2020. And his economic 
promises to the poor are in shreds, while his diplomatic 
flirtation with leftist world dictators only hints at his 
inclinations to gain more power.

  But Latin America has moved beyond coups, and this pivotal 
nation in a hemisphere of democracies has the means to remove 
Mr. Chavez by constitutional and especially nonviolent means.

  His two-day removal from office began when he tried to stack the 
board of the state-owned oil company in his favor. The company's 
executives revolted, threatening a cutoff of oil. That was a 
catalyst for pent-up opposition to Chavez. Business groups and 
labor unions joined in a giant protest, perhaps knowing that 
portions of the military were on their side. When gunshots were 
fired during a march on the presidential palace last Thursday, 
killing more than a dozen, military leaders forced Chavez to 
step aside. But then international pressure and renewed domestic 
support for Chavez forced the generals to let him take office 
again.

  The Bush administration all but welcomed the coup, tarnishing 
the US role as a champion of democracy. It, too, has a reason to 
repent.

   Venezuela's new dawn

 



  
BBC correspondent in Caracas

  Venezuelans awoke on Friday to a country transformed by the 
dramatic and violent events of the last 24 hours, which left at 
least 11 people dead and more than 80 injured.

  A general strike and an escalating oil industry stoppage that 
had threatened to cripple the country's economy were no more - 
and the country not only had a new president, business leader 
Pedro Carmona, but a new name.

  The country was no longer the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 
in honour of South American independence hero Simon Bolivar, one 
of former president Hugo Chavez's heroes.

  Now it is simply the Republic of Venezuela. The name change was 
Mr Carmona's first act as head of the transition government.

  His second was to announce the end of the three-day general 
strike he had called with the head of the Confederation of 
Venezuelan Workers (CTV) leader Carlos Ortega in support of 
protesting managers from state oil company PDVSA.

  
Shellshocked

  Managers were striking because Mr Chavez had filled the 
company's board of directors with his supporters.

  Despite the announcement, traffic was lighter than a normal 
Friday and many Venezuelans did not turn up for work.

  The country is in shellshock. On Thursday a peaceful rally of 
more than 100,000 mainly middle class Venezuelans had ended in 
bloodshed.

  As marchers called for Mr Chavez's resignation outside 
Miraflores, the presidential palace, shots were fired into the 
crowd. Eyewitness Euridice Ledesma said snipers fired on the 
marchers from rooftops near the palace.

  Film footage also caught armed supporters of Mr Chavez firing 
indiscriminately at the marchers.

  Later army chief, General Efrain Vasquez said some "Bolivarian" 
groups were indeed armed.

  "It was horrible. These groups were shooting at defenceless 
people," said photographer Luis Gomez.

  
Chavez's last day

  At the time, Mr Chavez was addressing the nation to assure them 
his government respected people's right to demonstrate and 
freedom of the press.

  Moments later he announced that he had taken five national 
television channels off the air for "telling lies about the 
government".

  The shootings were the final straw for the military. A 
succession of officers filled the TV screens to say they 
supported the people and that the killings were "not tolerable".

  As tanks surrounded Miraflores, Mr Chavez was holed up with 
senior military officers in a bid to save his presidency.

  In the early hours of the morning, chief of the armed forces 
General Lucas Rincon held a brief news conference to say Mr 
Chavez's resignation had been demanded and accepted.

  Earlier his wife, Marisabel, and children had left Caracas in 
the cover of darkness on a PDVSA jet for Barquisimeto in western 
Venezuela.

  Mr Chavez is currently detained at Fuerte Tiuna army base in 
Caracas and could face possible charges for his role in the 
killings.

  News of Mr Chavez's resignation caused hundreds of flag-waving 
and whistle-blowing Venezuelans to surround the city's air force 
base, La Carlota, in the hope of seeing Mr Chavez' departure 
from the country.

  Mr Chavez's exit has left Venezuela with a power vacuum and no 
obvious long-term leader. The challenge now is to heal the deep 
social divisions that exist within the country.

  "I think people are happy because Chavez has fallen. But there's 
also a feeling of uncertainty about how the country's obvious 
problems are going to be solved," said Ms Ledesma.

US Secretary of State Colin Powell, described as one of the few enlightened officials in President Bush's administration, is trying to "patch up" President Bush's statements, especially his latest one in which he made reckless threats at the "axis of evil," namely Iran, Iraq and North Korea. A day after President Bush's threat to crush these countries and use all means to prevent them from developing weapons of mass destruction, Secretary Powell said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that "characterizing these counties as the axis of evil does not mean that his government intends to invade them." He added: "We are prepared to initiate a dialogue, and we want to work with our friends and allies in the world on ways of dealing with such regimes." 
	
	
 These are fine words, but they do not reflect the reality, because the hard-line wing in the US administration comprising Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice have the final say in running affairs at the White House, and have direct influence on President Bush. 
	
	
 Oddly enough, speculations swirled in Washington that Powell listened to President Bush's speech and his threats to "the axis of evil" like any other US citizen. He had not read the speech before President Bush delivered it, as he was supposed to do by virtue of his post. The fact that he subsequently denied these speculations does not mean they are baseless. 
	
	
 At any rate, Secretary Powell's remark about the US administration's readiness to enter dialogue with these "evil" states and with Washington's friends on ways of dealing with them involves some contradictions. For he affirmed in the first speech that there would be no dialogue with Iraq until after it has accepted the return of the UN arms inspectors. 
	
	
 The current US administration will consult with no one, not even its closest allies, whether in Europe or its followers in the Third World, particularly in the Arab world. The US administration has already decided to "punish" any country it believes poses a danger to the Hebrew State. It lumped North Korea with Iran and Iraq as part of the "axis of evil" only to mislead Arabs and Muslims and to create the impression that Islam is not alone targeted. 
	
	
 The United States is these days ruled by an alliance between two main lobbies, the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby, which sees the world through the eyes of Ari'el Sharon and his extremist government. We therefore have to expect the worst in the near future. 
	
	
 President Bush is facing a recession and an economic crisis. He does not want to repeat his father's mistake, being defeated in the next elections because of economic factors. He is therefore planning to trigger wars here and there to revive the flagging arms industry. 
	
	
 The United States is currently run by a typical Texan mentality, which is closer to that of cowboys than to a civilized mentality that believes in dialogue and coexistence among peoples. This mentality simultaneously raises apprehensions and resentment, because international economic prosperity can be built on stability, not wars. A catastrophe would engulf every country if the US arms industry progressed at the expense of the world's security and stability. 
	
	
	


	
United Nations, New York, Nov 11, IRNA -- President Mohammad Khatami and his Venezuelan counterpart Hugo Chavez here Saturday cited cooperation among OPEC member countries as the key to forestalling further oil price declines. The Iranian president also hailed Chavez's recent efforts in travelling to OPEC and non-OPEC member countries, in a bid to garner support for propping up the sagging crude prices. Khatami, who had met with Chavez on the sidelines of a UN General Assembly session, also explained the ongoing Afghan crisis in the wake of the US-led strikes as well as the Islamic Republic's stance on the September 11 terror attacks in Washington and New York. He reiterated his call for a global peace coalition, based on justice, to stem the roots of terrorism. "Forming a world-wide coalition based on peace and justice to eradicate the ominous phenomenon of terrorism is a must," Khatami said. Chavez, whose country currently heads the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said that Venezuela's recent efforts in the form of his whirlwind trips to OPEC and non-OPEC member countries, were in line with the interests of all the oil producing countries. He also described cooperation among OPEC and non-OPEC countries as a boost to their national interests. Chavez voiced "the Latin American concern" on the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, saying Caracas was following the international stance on the fight against terrorism, violence and intrigues. OPEC is due to hold a meeting in Vienna on Wednesday to discuss the widely expected production cut. He also called for further expansion of bilateral cooperation between Tehran and Caracas in various international fields, such as OPEC and the Group of 77 (G77) of the world developing countries. Khatami is currently in New York to attend a special session of the UN General Assembly on 'Dialogue Among Civilizations' to have an international convention on the theme approved. The United Nations designated 2001, as the Year of 'Dialogue among Civilizations' on President Khatami's initiative.	


	
KABUL, Feb 10 (AFP) - Interim Afghan leader Hamid Karzai is to travel to the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, completing visits to the three countries that recognized the Taliban regime before September 11. 
	
	
 Kabul announced the Afghan embassy in Islamabad would reopen next week after Karzai's historic fence-mending visit to Pakistan on Friday. He has also made an official trip to Saudi Arabia. 
	
	
 In another step to heal festering wounds, Karzai on Saturday pardoned 350 captured Taliban soldiers, saying they were "innocent" and part of a general amnesty that allowed foot-soldiers to go free. 
	
	
 But the Afghan interim government branded Mullah Abdul Wakil Mutawakel, the Taliban foreign minister who surrendered to US forces in Kandahar Friday, as a war criminal who should be put on trial. 
	
	
 Taliban leaders "created misery for our people. The world has suffered because of what they did ... They deserve justice and to be treated as war criminals because they supported terrorism," Interim Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah said. 
	
	
 One of the closest aides to reclusive Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, he is seen as a potential source of crucial evidence against Omar and bin Laden, the chief suspect of the September 11 terror attacks who has eluded a US-led manhunt so far. 
	
	
 The United States meanwhile brought another 34 al-Qaeda and Taliban captives to a detention camp on a US naval base on Cuba Saturday, bringing the total of detainees held there to 220. 
	
	
 The new arrivals were dressed in standard-issue zippered orange jumpsuits. Because each was bound and shackled, the blue jackets they wore on the 27-hour flight were removed by scissors-wielding US troops as the prisoners descended from the plane into the tropical heat. 
	
	
 In Geneva the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it and Washington were at odds over Washington's decision not to recognise captured Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters as prisoners of war. 
	
	
 "There are divergent views between the US and the ICRC on the procedures which apply on how to determine that the persons detained are not entitled to prisoner of war status," the ICRC said in a statement. 
	
	
 "The US and the ICRC will pursue their dialogue on this issue." 
	
	
 US President George W. Bush decided Thursday that the 1949 Geneva Conventions would apply to captured Taliban fighters taken from Afghanistan to a US military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but not to al-Qaeda members there. 
	
	
 However, Washington said that neither group would be accorded prisoner of war status. 
	
	
 Concern also continued over signs that the US was expanding its war on terror to other countries. 
	
	
 While taking care to avoid directly criticizing Bush, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said it was unrealistic to see the world in terms of good and evil states. 
	
	
 In an interview published by the Swiss daily newspaper Blick on Saturday, Annan was asked about Bush's statement describing Iran, Iraq and North Korea as part of an "axis of evil." 
	
	
 Annan said, without specifically mentioning the US: "You can not divide the world between the good and the evil, because between them there are shades of gray." 
	
	
 EU commissioner Chris Patten, also speaking in a newspaper interview, accused Bush's administration of a dangerously "absolutist and simplistic" stance. 
	
	
 It was time European governments spoke up and stopped Washington before it went into "unilateralist overdrive", he told the British newspaper The Guardian. 
	
	
 In Ottawa, the Group of Seven industrialized nations called for intensified efforts to freeze terrorist financing and reported that at least 100 million dollars had been frozen since September 11. 
	
	
 "Significant results have already been achieved," said the final communique of finance ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. 
	
	
 "Since September 11, almost 150 countries and jurisdictions have issued orders to freeze terrorist assets and over 100 million dollars has been frozen worldwide," it said after the two-day gathering in Ottawa and in nearby Quebec. 
	
	
 In another sign of progress in cracking terrorist networks, court sources in Paris said an Islamic militant under investigation for an alleged plot to attack the French city of Strasbourg had admitted meeting two other terrorist suspects at a training camp in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 Yacine Akhnouche, arrested Monday, told police he had met suspected shoe bomber Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui at a training camp in Afghanistan in 2000, during one of several stays in the country. 
	
	
 Moussaoui, a Frenchman of Moroccan descent, is the first person charged in connection with the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. 
	
	
 Reid, a British national, was arrested after allegedly trying to light a fuse attached to explosives in his shoes while on a Paris to Miami flight on December 22. 
	
	
 Karzai meanwhile continued to wrestle with security problems as rival warlords tried to fill the power vacuum left by the fall of the Taliban. 
	
	
 On Saturday he met representatives of two warlords who clashed violently last week over who should be governor in eastern Paktia province. 
	
	
 "This is a very serious matter and Karzai wanted himself to be involved in finding a solution," Deputy Border Affairs Minister Mirza Ali told AFP. 
	
	
 Fifty people were killed in a two-day battle when Karzai's appointed governor, Padsha Khan, sent his forces to secure the governor's house in the provincial capital Gardez. 
	
	
 They were driven out by rival warlord Saif Ullah, who has refused to give up power. 
	
	
 Karzai has blamed Khan for the fighting and said it was "one more reason why we should finish warlordism in this country." 
	
	
 The clash has called into question Karzai's ability to govern beyond the Kabul area and bolstered his appeal for the deployment of more international troops in his country. 
	
	
 The search for kidnapped US journalist Daniel Pearl stretched into its 18th day in Pakistan with no sign of the Wall Street Journal correspondent, who was abducted while researching a story on Islamic militancy. 
	
	
	


	
In an antiterrorist war that at the time was initially launched as Operation Infinite Justice, it is infinitely difficult to reconcile oneself to the pictures of chained and humiliated Taliban and al-Qaida prisoners at the U.S. Guantanamo base on Cuba. The pictures resemble an attempt to satisfy a primitive thirst for revenge and convince the Americans that the Bush administration has not only succeeded in removing a regime of religious madmen in out-of-the-way Afghanistan, but also in taking prisoner some of those responsible for the terrorist acts on that day in September. 
	
	
 The U.S. and most recently the British governments reject the suggestion that the prisoners are being harmed, but this does not alter the fact that the pictures of hooded prisoners in chains are in themselves enough to paint a picture of a United States that in the name of self-righteousness - and equally worryingly: without any great amount of debate - has allowed itself to infringe international rules. 
	
	
 This impression is reinforced by the fact that for the time being at least the United States has ignored the Geneva Convention and refused to treat those taken prisoner as prisoners of war - something to which they have a right - until a competent court has decided differently. 
	
	
 Instead the superpower has entered a legal fog where the prisoners have been stamped with a nonsense term in international law: "battlefield prisoners." As such they face the prospect of being subjected to the due course of law and in the final analysis perhaps sentenced to death in closed military courts instead of in open courts, as is the right of prisoners of war under the terms of the Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 For most people it will of course be difficult to mobilize any great degree of understanding for those responsible for the bloody terrorism in the United States on that day in September, but what is at issue here is that at the present moment principles are at stake that could have far-reaching repercussions for the future war against terrorism. 
	
	
 With its behavior, therefore, the United States is not only compromising the image of the war against terrorism as an expression of a higher form of justice, but also of itself as an unshakeable defender of this same justice. This will undoubtedly rub off on the superpower's allies, including Denmark. And for this reason, too, they have a moral duty to speak out, as Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh, among others, did yesterday. Otherwise they face the risk not only of undermining the legitimacy of their own antiterrorism war at present, but also of sending out a signal that despots around the world will know how to exploit. 
	
	
 Many of them have already demonstrated great skill in their own behavior when it comes to exploiting the West's fear of terrorism. 
	
	
	


	
As prisoners from Al-Qa'ida and Taliban are being transported to the cells of the US Guantanamo base in Cuba, the United States' war on terrorism enters a new stage that is completely different from that of armed confrontation in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 Amidst the heat of military battles in Afghanistan, and on the background of the double crime that hit the United States, international opinion is now willing to overlook some inhumane practices that were made on this or that front. However, the situation has changed fundamentally since the batches of Al-Qa'ida and Taliban prisoners started arriving one after the other to Guatanamo base shackled and caged in cages that are no longer than eight feet and wider than six. The attention of the world moved from Afghanistan to Cuba to follow what Amnesty International considers an "uncomfortable situation" for the detainees. This has prompted two of Washington's closest allies, Britain and Australia, to express their "concern" over the way the prisoners were transported from Afghanistan and the way they are being treated in captivity. 
	
	
 It is obvious that statements by US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that the detainees are "illegitimate fighters" upon home the Geneva convention on POW's does not apply have not helped alleviate world concern over the US abandoning its (until now) well-known commitment to the principles of justice in treating the Al-Qa'ida and Taliban prisoners. 
	
	
 The continued US ambiguity in using the title of prisoners, and specifically prisoners of war or "illegitimate" combatants, and the possibility of trying them in private and closed martial court, do not help the United States maintain international sympathy with its war. 
	
	
 As the campaign of Western criticism of the United States heightens, it has become urgent for Washington to clarify its stand on treating the prisoners and their destiny so that it would not be recorded in history that the number one democracy in the war won the war on terrorism in weeks and lost the reputation of commitment to principles of human justice that it took centuries to gain. 
	
	
	


	
ANKARA, Dec 15 (A.A) - Interior Minister Rustu Kazim Yucelen released a decree on Saturday, and announced measures to be taken against illegal migration by sea. 
	
	
 The decree said that human smuggling incidents from the Turkish coasts to Greek islands, Italy and France increased recently due to economic, social and political reasons. 
	
	
 It said that the Coast Guard units had intercepted a total of 6 thousand 743 foreigners since January 1, 1996. 2,816 of these foreigners were captured in the first 11 months of 2001. 
	
	
 The Coast Guard Command has been working on a report to give detailed information about its activities against human smuggling and number of foreigners intercepted between January 1 and November 26, 2001. 
	
	
 According to the report, Turkish and Greek flagged ships, fishing boats and speed boats were used by human smugglers. 
	
	
 ``Most of the illegal migration incidents by sea happened in western provinces of Izmir, Aydin and Mugla. 28 out of 63 incidents were reported in Bodrum township of Mugla. These incidents generally increase in spring and fall. Turkish citizens from southern and southeastern provinces accounted for 31 percent. Iraqi and Afghan immigrants followed them. Having regard to the fact that 95.1 percent of foreign immigrants were coming from African and Middle Eastern countries, it becomes more difficult to prevent illegal migration from under developed countries to European countries via Turkey,`` it added.	


	
Washington, January 26 (XINHUA) -- US Secretary of State Colin Powell has asked President George W. Bush to reverse the president's decision on al-Qa'ida and Taliban detainees and declare the terrorists as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention, the Washington Times reported on Saturday. 
	
	
 A four-page internal White House memorandum obtained by the Washington Times shows that Powell made the request and that Bush' s National Security Council plans to meet on the matter Monday morning. 
	
	
 Bush decided on January 18 that hundreds of Taliban and members of Usama bin Ladin's al-Qa'ida army are detainees, and not prisoners of war, and thus not subject to rights in the Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 "The secretary of state has requested that you reconsider that decision," White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales wrote in a memo to Bush. "Specifically, he has asked that you conclude that GPW (Geneva Convention II on the Treatment of Prisoners of War) does apply to both al-Qa'ida and the Taliban fighters." 
	
	
 Human rights groups and some European countries have protested Bush's decision, and have been critical of the living conditions for 158 detainees at the US Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
	
	
	


	
President Bush's projection of Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' and his threat of military action against them has evoked world-wide criticism. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said after meeting US Vice President Dick Cheney in Washington that there is no evidence of weapons' proliferation against these nations to substantiate the US charge. French officials said that the rhetoric of good and evil is not suitable for the realities of today's world. Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that Bush has made a 'big mistake' by lumping the three nations together as they are different from each other. NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson said in New York that credible evidence will be prerequisite for NATO's support for any military action against the three nations. 
	
	
 The lumping of Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' by President Bush has certainly not raised US image. It has rather tarnished it, since the international community expects a mature, compassionate and civilised conduct from the United States as the only superpower in the world. It should have been on the side of the smaller and weaker nations, rather than targeting them one by one in the pursuit of its global agenda. It should have worked to eliminate injustice, instead of trying to harass other countries for national prejudices. The world expects a civilised conduct from the United States in place of arrogance, discrimination and injustice. Washington is, in fact, treading a path of coercion, intimidation and blackmailing against the smaller and weaker nations. President Bush is intolerant to the dissent to his policy of domination in total negation of the lofty principles of morality, ethic and democracy, which he assertively holds so dear to his heart. If terrorism is to be fought successfully, the United States should better withdraw its support to the forces of injustice, tyranny and oppression in the world. Fight against poverty alone will not be a productive effort to fight terrorism. It's injustice that breeds hatred and revolt. Let Middle East be the test ground for US sincerity to fight terrorism. Its unfettered support to Israel is based on injustice and this distortion in its policies needs to be removed to ensure its own security as well as that of its allies. 
	
	
	


	
The attacks on the World Trade Center Towers and the Pentagon were attacks on the freedoms and values for which the United States and the Western world stand, President Bush declared shortly afterward, and many people in Europe repeated it after him. 
	
	
 There is a great deal of truth in that, but in the light of what has happened afterwards, the question arises as to whether the Americans and their allies themselves are not sometimes inclined to sacrifice these values for the "good cause." There is no doubt that a military operation and intensified security measures were imperative after the terrible tragedy of 11 September. That al-Qa'ida terrorists and Taliban fighters are not very concerned about the human suffering that they have caused is also generally known. However, the ends -- dealing with those opponents -- does not justify all the means. 
	
	
 There is, in the first place, the case of the military action in Afghanistan. Apart from the reasons or justification for such an action, all the combatants' war conduct must be constantly tested against the standards of international humanitarian law; that is, the rules which curb the use of force during a military operation. Back in 1949, it was agreed by nearly all the states in the world that the sufferings of war must henceforth become more bearable, especially for those who are not directly involved in the conflict. These rules, laid down in the four Geneva Conventions, provide, among other things, for the protection of sick and wounded servicemen and prisoners of war. In addition, attempts must be made to prevent any unnecessary suffering by both military personnel and civilians by, for instance, imposing restrictions on the use of weapons. 
	
	
 But the greatest attention is paid to the fate of the civilian population: In principle, the latter can never be the object of a military operation. Hence, humanitarian law requires that in all circumstances a distinction be made between military targets and those not involved in the armed conflict. The two supplementary protocols to the Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1977, increase, among other things, the protection of the civilian population. Many countries are parties to them, but the United States has not ratified these protocols, so that the additional protection they offer is difficult to enforce in a conflict in which US troops are taking part. 
	
	
 Although it is doubtful that all the news reaches us from Afghanistan, a great many press reports suggest that humanitarian law was violated regularly over the past few weeks. This has happened despite solemn pledges to the United Nations that the United States "is committed to minimizing civilian casualties and damage to civilian property." 
	
	
 Hence you can hardly speak of a "targeting error" when a Red Cross warehouse, although clearly recognizable by the large red cross painted on the roof, was shelled twice by US aircraft. Such a building enjoys the highest possible protection, and can and should never be the object of an attack, unless it is clearly established that it is being used for military purposes. 
	
	
 In other case, too, it seems doubtful that the crucial distinction between military and civilian targets was made systematically. Newspaper headlines such as "United Nations Confirms US Bombing of Village and Mosque" and "100 Killed in Bombing in Eastern Afghanistan" speak for themselves. According to witnesses, these were attacks in an area where neither al-Qa'ida troops nor Taliban had been observed. Even if these attacks were directed against a clear military target, the large number of civilian casualties would still never be justifiable, because whoever plans a military attack must take all precautions to prevent such a tragedy. 
	
	
 Not only with the protection of the civilian population does something sometimes go wrong. Secretary Rumsfeld's statements (on 20 November 2001) that "the United States is not inclined to negotiate surrenders, nor are we in a position, with relatively small numbers of forces on the ground, to accept prisoners," and that "my hope is that they will be either killed or taken prisoner (by the Northern Alliance)" also suggested that death would be the only way out of the conflict for the Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters. That would amount to a flagrant violation of humanitarian law: whoever ceases fighting for whatever reason is entitled to protection. It is all the more to be deplored that such statements come from somebody who, as a senior commander, serves as an example to others regarding the observance of rules of humanitarian law. 
	
	
 Now, nearly two months later, concern about the fate of the captive Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters has further increased. Moving the captives to the Guantanamo Bay military base on Cuba is rightly whipping up a storm of protest. Humanitarian law leaves no doubt that those who fall captive in their opponent's hands are entitled at all times to decent treatment, even if they do not qualify for prisoner of war status. Transporting these people, shackled hand and foot and with hoods over their heads, shaving their beards -- which form part of their religious identity -- and their "accommodation" in half-open and cages that are much too small can probably never pass this test... 
	
	
 The consequences of 11 September are also making themselves felt far from the battlefield. Shortly after its decision to take military action, the Bush administration also decided to provide the press with only sparse information about the course of the operation. Because press freedom -- the jewel of the US Constitution -- can be restricted for reasons of national security. The right of citizens to such information about their government's actions is crippled by the fact that it is being accepted for the present without much complaint. 
	
	
 Under the protest of international and US human rights organizations but with the approval of large sections of the population, antiterrorism measures are being adopted in great haste. Foreigners suspected of maintaining (loose) ties with terrorist organizations can be detained indefinitely. There is uncertainty about the precise number, but it is certain that over 1,000 men from the Middle East have already been arrested. 
	
	
 In the media, the possibility of questioning presumed terrorists very roughly is also being considered aloud. The need for timely and accurate information about possible new attacks is naturally particularly great, but whether the global ban on torture can be abused on that account is another matter. 
	
	
 What raises even more questions is the order that President Bush issued last November. Through that, the United States can detain and try anybody who is not a US citizen and who is suspected of being a member of al-Qa'ida or of being involved in international terrorism in one way or another. Only special military commissions can try them. It is stated in black and white that it is hardly feasible for these commissions to apply the normal principles of law and rules of evidence. Consequently, evidence will be accepted that "a normal person" deems to have the value of evidence. Hence guilt need not be established "beyond reasonable doubt," nor is there any mention of a presumption of innocence. Appeal is not possible, but the death penalty is. On the other hand, US Taliban or al-Qa'ida fighters, such as the recently captured John Walker Lindh, will be tried by ordinary US criminal courts. 
	
	
 There also seems to be a difference among the foreigners: In all likelihood, captured British fighters will be sent to Britain after questioning. Presumed war criminals such as Milosevic enjoy all the guarantees of a fair trial, but the Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters at Guantanamo will get a trial which falls far short of the basic standards of the US Constitution and the treaty on civil and political rights ratified by the United States. 
	
	
 Not in the United States alone are the screws being tightened. A number of other countries have sharpened their laws following 11 September, from increased detention possibilities to stricter legislation on asylum and immigration. In December 2001, the UK proclaimed a state of emergency and passed the Antiterrorism, Crime, and Security Act. Whenever there is a suspicion that a foreigner is involved in international terrorism, he will be arrested and imprisoned. If it emerges that the person concerned cannot be removed from British territory because he is in serious danger in his own country, he can be detained almost indefinitely under this law. 
	
	
 Other states have used the US tragedy to polish their own image. Out of well-understood self-interest, countries such as Russia, China, and Israel joined in the Bush administration's anti-terrorism campaign, because it enabled them to compare their domestic situation with the US situation and ask for moral support for the fight they have been waging against terrorism for years. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called Palestinian leader Arafat "Our Usama Bin Ladin." 
	
	
 The fight against terrorism is undoubtedly justified, but, as with every struggle, it also holds true that the fundamental principles of human rights and humanitarian law must be respected. Observance of these rules will not insure that the fight against terrorism is lost; it will prove respect for human dignity, of which the West is rightly a champion. 
	
	
	


	
LONDON, Jan 24 (AFP) -- British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Thursday [24 January] it was "far preferable" that British prisoners held at the US Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba should face justice in Britain. 
	
	
 Three Britons are among 158 captured al-Qa'ida and Taliban fighters detained at the camp. They were captured in Afghanistan during the US-led military campaign against the country's now-crumbled hardline Taliban regime. 
	
	
 "It is far preferable if they are British citizens for them to come to the United Kingdom and face justice here," Straw told BBC radio. 
	
	
 He was speaking after American John Walker Lindh, captured while fighting for the Taliban, arrived handcuffed and shackled at Dulles International Airport outside the US capital late Wednesday and was taken to a nearby jail. 
	
	
 He faces trial in his own country on charges of conspiring to kill US nationals and supporting terrorist groups. 
	
	
 The US military put on hold transfers of prisoners to the Cuba base Wednesday. 
	
	
 International criticism of conditions at the makeshift camp have grown since the first detainees were transferred from Afghanistan earlier this month. 
	
	
 The prisoners are being held at the temporary outdoor detention facility called "Camp X-Ray" where each has a separate cell with a concrete floor, wooden roof and chain-link walls.	


	
Spanish premier, EU leader urge Russia to ratify Kyoto Protocol 
	
	
 Text of report by Spanish news agency Efe 
	
	
 Barcelona, 14 March: The current president of the EU, Jose Maria Aznar, and the president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, have handed over a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they urge him to promote the ratification by Russia of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. In the letter, to which Efe has had access, Aznar and Prodi explain that on 4 March the council of EU environment ministers agreed the adoption of a decision for approval of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change on behalf of the European Community. They explain that this agreement is an important step for the EU in fulfilling the political pledge to achieve ratification of the Protocol before the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development. To this end, Aznar and Prodi report that only the internal ratification processes in each of the member states have now to be concluded and they emphasize that these are at an advanced stage and in some cases have been completed. "Therefore, we have complete confidence that the instruments of ratification of the European Community and of the 15 member states will be able to be lodged with the Secretariat of the United Nations within the time scale anticipated, in other words, in early June of this year," they add. However, the letter emphasizes that for the Kyoto Protocol to be able to enter into force in the near future it is not enough for EU ratification to be guaranteed and they thus urge Putin to ensure that Russia also moves ahead with ratification. They make this request "convinced of the Russian Federation's resolute commitment to the Kyoto Protocol" and believing that in this manner the EU and Russia would continue to show the "leadership" which they believe they have shared "with such fruitful results, in international cooperation in the fight against climate change". 
	
	
	


	
Australia's plans to construct a space port on Christmas Island, located just a stone's throw, a mere 500 kilometres south of Jakarta, has concerned some in the Indonesian Government. Although diplomatic overtures to express official objections have not yet been made, the government through the National Space and Flight Agency has already warned of the possible risks facing Indonesia. The nation should certainly be concerned about the plans to build a rocket launch pad, work on the infrastructure for which is due to start in 2002, with launches beginning from 2004. The problem is, this large-scale project right in our own backyard could not only potentially cause space debris consisting of bits of rocket, fuel and satellites to fall into Indonesian territory, but will also disrupt flights and shipping. 
	
	
 If a rocket launch fails, debris weighing hundreds of tonnes will be scattered over the densely-populated island of Java or the tourist island of Bali, and on to the east as far as Timor. 
	
	
 The memory Russia's Mir space station which after 15 years fell to earth on 23 March 2001 is still fresh of. Fortunately shrapnel from the former space station, which measured 33 x 30 x 27 metres and weighed 137 tonnes, burned up as it re-entered the earth's atmosphere somewhere over the Pacific Ocean between Chile and Australia. Nevertheless, intact pieces of debris weighing up to 20 to 30 tonnes fell into the Pacific Ocean. 
	
	
 Prior to that, two Soviet satellites struck the earth. Cosmos 1402 in January 1978 fell over the Northern Hemisphere and Cosmos 954, which contained radioactive substances, crashed above the uninhabited tundra of Canada in September 1977. 
	
	
 Even more worrying is the possibility that a space station could be transformed into a military base and pose a threat to Indonesia's national sovereignty. At such close proximity, if bilateral relations with Australia were to take a turn for the worse, firing at Indonesia would be extremely easy. 
	
	
 On the other hand, Christmas Island is certainly an ideal location for rocket launches due to its proximity to the Equator and the geostationary orbit (GSO). [passage omitted on technical details of operation of GSO] 
	
	
 Notwithstanding the above, in reality only three of the 15 launch pad centres worldwide are located near the Equator - Kourou, San Marco and Sriharikota. But the famous US space centre, the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida is located relatively far from the Equator. Therefore, plans to construct a space port should be moved from Christmas Island if Australia is really willing to listen to Indonesia's objections. 
	
	
 International law governing accountability if one nation's space debris falls on another is already in existence. The main convention is the UN Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, 28 March 1972, known as the 1972 Liability Convention. 
	
	
 The Convention basically sets out the responsibility of the launching state, either jointly or collectively, for the consequences of a launch failure from the time of launching through to the re-entry of a satellite to the Earth's atmosphere. The Convention also sets out various claims that can be made by states who have suffered damages as a result of other states' space projects. 
	
	
 As the nation most likely to suffer the impact of the Australian Space Port, Indonesia could rely on the simplest article in the Liability Convention, Section 14. This section allows states who have suffered damages to claim compensation through the International Claims Commission, which acts as the representative of the appellant state against the launching state (in this case Australia) or any other international organisation which can be classed as a launching state. 
	
	
 Of course, lodging a claim is not as simple as clapping one's hands. Indonesia at the very least needs to sign the UN Convention on Space as well as ratify several other treaties governing national activities in outer space. 
	
	
 These UN Conventions are the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies 1967 (Space Treaty 1967), the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects 1972 (Liability Convention 1972), and finally, the Convention on Registration of Objections launched into Outer Space 1974 (Registration Convention 1974). 
	
	
 So far, the Indonesian Government has only ratified the 1972 Liability Convention. This convention only applies to space objects that fall into Indonesian sovereign territory. Indonesia has only adopted one compensation principle, the Absolute Liability principle. This principle means that the burden of proof that the claimant state has suffered damages does not lie on the state submitting its damages claim. It is sufficient at law to demonstrate the fact of the damage caused as a result of the space object identified as belonging to the launching state or a state that has participated in the space object launching. 
	
	
 A National Space and Flight Agency working paper suggest a high degree of difficulty if Indonesia, as a state that has suffered damage, were to lodge a damages claim. In the case of objections to the Christmas Island space station, Indonesia would need to be able to show that damage that has occurred within its territorial area was caused by space objects launched from the Christmas Island station. This would of course require advanced technology and great cost to bring the matter to a claim submission. 
	
	
 But in conversation with Kompas on Sunday (17 Mar), one of Indonesia's few space law experts, Prof Dr Priyatna Abdurrasyid, expressed a different opinion. Indonesia would not need to produce further evidence to substantiate its claim, he said. It would suffice to submit a claim to the UN Claims Commission and state that the space debris in Indonesia had originated from the Australian space centre. 
	
	
 "If Australia then denies the claim, we need only demand that Australia produce proof that the space debris did not originate from its space centre activities. If a deadlock in negotiations occurs, the parties can ask the UN Claims Commission as a neutral party to act as adjudicator. This is no different to arbitration hearings to resolve other cases," Priyatna said. 
	
	
 Unfortunately, historical precedent shows that claiming compensation is no easy matter. In claiming compensation from the Soviet Union over Cosmos 954, Canada was forced to navigate numerous procedural complications. This is a very important lesson for Indonesia. 
	
	
 Unlike other experts, Priyatna believes that Indonesia should not be too concerned [about the Australian planned space station]. "In principle, my personal opinion is that we shouldn't go against the current. Rather we should the use the current to our mutual benefit," he said. 
	
	
 Meaning that rather than challenging and issuing objections to the Australian space project, Indonesia should take advantage of our southern neighbour's space activities. 
	
	
 "The Space Treaty 1967 obliges launching states to open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states in all its activities. The treaty also pledges that the launching of space objects be purely for humanitarian purposes and not for military purposes," Priyatna said. 
	
	
 The basic principles of the Space Treaty 1967 oblige Australia as the launching state to open the possibility of humanitarian cooperation in the field of space endeavour. "Australia is not allowed to prevent other states who want to cooperate on its space centre. Indonesia can exploit this principle of the Space Treaty 1967. Rather than issuing a letter of objection to the Australian Government, wouldn't it be better to join them in our own national interest?" he asked. 
	
	
 The kangaroo country should implement risk management procedures before opening the space station on Christmas Island, and open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states, and open complete access to cooperation to all states without exception. These principles are upheld in the Space Treaty 1967. 
	
	
 Australia should adhere to the Cardinal Principle of International Law, which states that all nations in the world must first respect and promote the humanitarian interests and progress of all humankind. But the problem is, who can ensure that these guidelines will indeed be adhered to? 
	
	
	


	
A 26 November 2001 article in Zhongguo Renkou Bao reported that in April 2001, the State Family Planning Commission initiated its transprovincial floating population investigation by surveying the marriage, birth, and birth control situations of 27,879 migrant women between the ages of 15 and 49. 
	
	
 Of the women surveyed, 87.2 percent (24,310) were married, higher than the national average of 82.3 percent (according to the 1997 National Population and Reproductive Health Survey). The average number of 15- to 19-year-old migrant women who are married with children is higher than the national average. The average for migrant women in the other age groups is lower than the national average. 
	
	
 Only about 30 percent of the migrant women who are married with two or more children have obtained official migrant population marriage documentation as required by the Procedures For Managing Floating Population Family Planning. This is less than the registration rate of migrant women with no or one child. 
	
	
 The percentage of married migrant women using contraceptives is 90.6 percent, higher than the national average of 83.4 percent. Moreover, those with children mostly use long-term contraceptive methods. The rate of using long-term contraceptive methods is higher among women with one son than women with one daughter. Those with two children mostly undergo sterilization. However, the use of sterilization among "households with two daughters" is significantly less than among households with at least one son.

Foreign Minister Celso Lafer transmitted a warning to United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, with whom he spent 30 minutes yesterday, from the Brazilian Government: without help from the US, Argentina could enter a state of social rebellion and open a new front of geopolitical instability in South America. Powell's reaction, according to a Planalto source, was one of "interest and attention". No more than that. The Brazilian Government's perception of Argentina's future is pessimistic. "Their economic agenda alone is overwhelming," the source commented. It requires the creation of a Central Bank capable of administering a floating exchange rate system and a regime of inflation goals; the establishment of a safety network for the debilitated financial system; the restructuring of the tax policy, and the elaboration of a law that ensures fiscal discipline. Without US help, via the IMF, the country will not be able to attain the most basic economic, social and political stability, and could contaminate the subcontinent, Lafer warned. 
	
	
 [passage omitted] 
	
	
 "La plata" or social rebellion 
	
	
 Foreign Minister Celso Lafer carried a dramatic warning from President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to the US Government. In his conversation with Secretary of State Colin Powell, the Brazilian Foreign Minister stated clearly that to leave Argentina to its own fate, as seems to be the George Bush administration's choice, is to pave the way for social rebellion there, which will contaminate other countries on the continent and create another area of political instability on the planet. 
	
	
 The Argentina theme was also covered in Lafer's talks yesterday with Commerce Secretary Don Evans and with US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick. According to a Planalto Palace source, the reaction from Powell as well as from Evans and Zoellick was of "interest and attention". Nothing more. 
	
	
 Translating roughly, what Minister Lafer tried to tell the Americans is that the financial cost of an international rescue of Argentina, now, led by the IMF and other multilateral credit agencies, will be lower than the cost of fighting, later on, chaos in its social, political, and - why not? - military forms on the continent. 
	
	
 South America is already living with complex problems in Venezuela and, above all, in Colombia, where President Andres Pastrana is unable to combat the guerrilla activities of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] and failed in the recent attempt to negotiate an agreement with its militants. For Brazilian diplomacy, Pastrana lost time and credibility on a failed bet: the negotiations with FARC, letting them control territory the size of Switzerland in the heart of the continent. 
	
	
 To add a country like Argentina to this list of problems is to allow the growth of a dangerous focus of social dissatisfaction, which is tending to express itself outside of any institutional control. Argentine society is divorcing itself from political parties and national institutions, and it is in such an environment that radical responses germinate, such as authoritarian regimes and the formation of guerrilla groups. 
	
	
 The ill effects of the Argentine crisis can contaminate the nearest countries first, like Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia. And there is no guarantee that a political destabilization of the region would bypass even Chile, where memories of the military dictatorship are still very strong. One cannot ignore the fact that, only 20 years ago, all these countries - including Brazil and Peru - were ruled by generals. 
	
	
 There is an entire. political and diplomatic argument in the conversations with representatives of the Bush government that transcends the economic-financial discussions, to which the subject was restricted, and which encompasses the very survival of democracy in South America. It is a new approach, which tries to sensitize US authorities through the use of geopolitical arguments. Not to take into account the impact of destabilization in South America in a world already complicated by the Middle East, India versus Pakistan, Afghanistan, and badly-resolved problems in Eastern Europe, "is not to have a strategic vision," according to the assessment that is being made in Planalto Palace and which was clearly emphasized during Lafer's meetings with Powell, Zoellick and Evans. 
	
	
 The Brazilian Government's perception of Argentina's future is pessimistic. There is a stress factor in the content and volume of the needs of that country, which on its own will not be able to take the steps absolutely necessary for its reconstruction. This is the understanding of sources very close to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and it is also guiding the analyses of the economic department. 
	
	
 What is underway in the neighboring country, according to information gathered by the Brazilian Government, is the establishment of a Central Bank - which 10 years ago abdicated from the traditional functions of currency and credit manager - that is capable of working with a floating exchange rate system and a regime of inflation goals, like Brazil's Central Bank; a safety network for the financial system whose health is already extremely undermined; the restructuring of the tax policy so that the tax collection machine can create conditions for the government to draw up a budget without so many uncertainties; and a fiscal responsibility law that imposes some discipline on the relationship between central government and the provinces. 
	
	
 "This is the minimum that has to be done. Their economic agenda alone is overwhelming," comments one high-ranking member of the Brazilian Government. Alone, and under the command of a president who managed to create a strong political coalition explained only by his own survival instinct, Argentines will be unable to attain the most basic economic, social and political stability. How does this affect Brazil? To answer a question of this nature, the Brazilian Foreign Minister would surely resort to Ortega y Gasset: "I am I and my circumstances. If I do not save them, I do not save myself."

The buffer zones that Ariel Sharon intends to establish are an explicit admission that Israelis can no longer live by the sword, that the occupation is not working, and Israeli reprisals are not meeting with success. Thinking of building a Great Wall of China in the Middle East, replete with elaborate fences and tunnels, is conceding that Israel is not safe, not a normal country. It cannot integrate itself into the region, it is an alien seedling and, thus, it is better to isolate and fortify itself as a lowly outpost. 
	
	
 A total disengagement from the Palestinians, complete with walls and razor wire, might provide Israel its long-desired security and might free it of the burden of trying to control seven million desperate Palestinians, any number of whom are willing to die in order to end the occupation. But separation will not mean an end to the occupation and no Israeli government can provide security as long as it persists in its efforts to maintain its presence beyond Israel's pre-1967 borders and to retain territories inhabited by millions of Palestinians. By now, it should be clear to everyone that retaliating against every act of Palestinian resistance with Israel's superior ability to punish Palestinians does not provide the security that Israelis are demanding. 
	
	
 The only way out of the current spiral of violence is for Israel to limit itself to areas within which it can assume responsibility for its citizens' security. This means a return to Israel's pre-1967 borders. 
	
	
 Practically speaking, a buffer zone will be near impossible to erect. A physical border between Israel and a new Palestinian state will be twisted and distorted to accommodate Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. Unilateral separation without a negotiated agreement could be realized - only if Israel is willing to uproot around 100 settlements. Sharon says flatly he will not withdraw from a single settlement. He thinks that every settlement is important and is determined that Israelis must retain as much land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as possible. 
	
	
 Then there is the eventual goal of the peace process: the coexistence of Israel with the state of Palestine. But Israel has not once deigned to propose that the Palestinians live with the Israelis as full citizens in the same sate. Israel does not want the Palestinians to be part of the same country, or have one of their own. 
	
	
 By a margin of 2-1, Israelis think Sharon has no plan to end the violence and the buffer idea buttresses this long-standing view. Sharon has not brought the Israeli public security. With grim determination, he has destroyed the peace process and the Oslo agreements. And now he doggedly continues to demolish and prevent any hope of a road to peaceful coexistence. Israelis do not wonder any longer how to get along with Palestinians but how to avoid the need for it. Sharon has ensured that Israelis are rapidly absorbing the lesson that no place in Israel can be considered safe. 
	
	
 A wall and miles of fences is not the best of solutions. Does anybody believe that the intifada can end as long as Israel persists in the occupation of the territories and Palestinians are willing to die in large numbers to deny Israel that privilege? 
	
	
	


	
BEIJING, March 6 (AFP) -- China's foreign minister on Wednesday pledged to expand "constructive and cooperative" relations with the United States, in a notably conciliatory performance at his annual get-together with the media. 
	
	
 "We are ready to work together with the US side to narrow differences, expand common ground, increase exchanges and promote cooperation in order to further push forward the constructive and cooperative ties," Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan told journalists. 
	
	
 In a press conference on the sidelines of the current full session of parliament -- his annual opportunity to present China's foreign policy objectives to the outside world -- Tang largely steered clear of subjects over which Beijing and Washington disagree. 
	
	
 Even when the perennially divisive issue of Taiwan was raised by reporters, he offered only mild and routine criticism of US policy towards the island. 
	
	
 China had always "firmly opposed" the US Taiwan Affairs Act, which mandates by law the US defense of Taiwan and forms the basis for US arms sales to the island, he said. 
	
	
 Tang called on Washington to uphold the so-called "one China policy" -- the centrepiece of Beijing's dealings with Taiwan which categorises the island is an inalienable part of mainland territory -- but failed to specifically condemn Washington's arms sales to Taipei. 
	
	
 However he stressed that Taiwan remained the crucial issue between the two. 
	
	
 "I wish to emphasize that the Taiwan question remains the most sensitive and most important issue at the core of the Sino-US relationship," he said. 
	
	
 Sino-US ties have greatly improved since Beijing backed the US fight against global terrorism and its bombing campaign of terrorist targets in Afghanistan following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States. 
	
	
 The tone of Tang's press conference was markedly different to that of last year's equivalent event, during which he roundly criticised United States arms sales to Taiwan. 
	
	
 Sino-US relations took a more serious dip a month afterwards during a crisis over the collision between a US surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet over the South China Sea. 
	
	
 Tang conceded there had been "twists and turns" following US President George W. Bush's accession to the US presidency in early last year, but said the relationship had improved with Bush's visits to China in October and last month. 
	
	
 "President Jiang and President Bush held an important meeting in Shanghai in October where they agreed that both countries would work together to build a constructive and cooperative relationship. 
	
	
 "This is a very important consensus," Tang said. 
	
	
 When asked whether the anti-terror alliance meant good relations between the country were based purely on expediency, Tang disagreed, saying cooperation "was long-term". 
	
	
 China will seek to improve the relationship still further during visits by President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Hu Jintao to Washington later this year. 
	
	
 Tang further announced that Liu Jieyi, the director general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry section in charge of arms control, was in Washington for talks on weapons proliferation and issues concerning the global security. 
	
	
 US accusations of China's alleged proliferation of weapons of mass destruction have long been countered by Beijing with loud opposition to US weapon sales to Taiwan. 
	
	
 Overall, despite a "grim and complicated" post September 11 international order, China still maintained that "peace, stability and development" remained the main themes characterizing the world environment, Tang said. 
	
	
	


	
AMMAN -- The unemployment rate among the country's 48,000 engineers has dropped by 1.5 per cent since last year, a senior official at the Jordan Engineers Association (JEA) said on Thursday. 
	
	
 The rate last year was around 8.5 per cent, but in the first two months of 2002 it dropped to 7 per cent, said JEA President Azzam Hneidi. The total of unemployed engineers currently stands at 3,360, he said. 
	
	
 The association last year provided 867 unemployed engineers with job opportunities in several public and private institutions, thereby contributing to the decline, according to Hneidi. 
	
	
 The association will continue contacting the government and private institutions to supply them with engineers, he added. 
	
	
 Both the JEA and the Ministry of Housing and Public Works last year trained 759 new engineering graduates over the course of one year to prepare them for job opportunities, he said. 
	
	
 One of the JEA's obligations stipulated in its bylaws is to provide training for its members. This training takes the form of a full-time internship lasting from six months to one year, during which graduates are placed in professional settings to gain firsthand experience in the workplace. 
	
	
 "The aim is to give the engineers a real chance to practise what they studied in theory at university," said Hneidi. 
	
	
 Engineers specialised in the electricity field, for example, are hired to work in an electric company for eight hours per day. 
	
	
 "The trainee is paid between JD120-150 per month, and the association defrays JD30-50 of that monthly salary," said the JEA official. 
	
	
 The association annually allocates JD100,000 for training graduates. This year it plans to increase the number of trainees to 1,000 graduates, which will require more funds. 
	
	
 "The association is willing to cover it," Hneidi said. 
	
	
 As the engineering sector has more graduates than job openings, the association's representative offices in the Gulf states look to bring engineers from Jordan to work in the Gulf, said Hneidi. 
	
	
 Unemployment prevails mainly among chemical, mechanical and civil engineering graduates, he said, adding that engineers specialised in electrical, computer and architectural engineering have no problem finding jobs. 
	
	
 The number of students in Jordanian public and private universities' engineering departments is around 6,000, excluding those in agricultural engineering. Around 2,000 new engineers enter the job market on an annual basis. 
	
	
 Currently, many engineering students in universities prefer to specialise in the electrical or computer disciplines because the demand for them is higher. 
	
	
	


	
Regular British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, Robin Cook signalled tonight. 
	
	
 His remarks came as the militia began talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar after Northern Alliance troops finally entered Kunduz. 
	
	
 SAS [Special Air Service] soldiers and their American counterparts are fighting alongside the Alliance as they have swept across large swathes Afghanistan. 
	
	
 But Commons Leader Mr Cook said: "If you look back over the past month there has been no situation in which we have put British troops into the ground civil war and I don't myself imagine that's going to change." 
	
	
 British troops remained on 48 hour stand-by but the situation was "better than anybody could have hoped for", according to Mr Cook. 
	
	
 "We will continue obviously to keep the situation under review, but frankly, I think we should welcome the fact that their presence has not been needed in Afghanistan. This is not a reverse, it's actually an advance," he added. 
	
	
 News of the Kandahar negotiations came after the Taliban control crumbled in their final northern stronghold of Kunduz following mass surrender. 
	
	
 The city's top Taliban commander was among thousands of Afghan and foreign troops who gave themselves up after days of talks interspersed with fighting. 
	
	
 However, night fell before the Alliance could secure the city, increasing the danger of militants fighting back. 
	
	
 Hours after the vanguard entered from the west, a tank column halted its advance from the east, fearing hostile fire. 
	
	
 The surrender took days to hammer out, primarily because hard core Taliban and foreign troops from Usama Bin Ladin's al-Qa'ida terror network did not want to give up. 
	
	
 The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold following the rapid collapse of their regime across the majority of the country. 
	
	
 Hundreds of foreign fighters captured in the siege of the northern city were killed in a prison riot at a fortress outside Mazar-e-Sharif, the Northern Alliance said. 
	
	
 But that did not stop Taliban commanders discussing the surrender of Kandahar, following calls from 70 Afghan tribal leaders for them to avert bloodshed. 
	
	
 "There are some talks and negotiations going on there (in Kandahar) with the Taliban to surrender themselves," Gen Mohammed Zaer Azimi said in Herat. 
	
	
 Ruud Lubbers, the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, said Afghanistan was not yet secure for aid agencies to operate in and "not enough" food had been taken into the country. 
	
	
 "It is not at all a secure environment," he told the programme. 
	
	
 "So although our international staff went back to Kabul and hope to go back to the other places ... one cannot say it is safe in the country and secure enough. 
	
	
 "So there is quite a job to be done in creating a secure environment for humanitarian assistance." 
	
	
 His concerns echoed those voiced by leading charity Oxfam, which said instability across the country was hampering aid efforts. 
	
	
 But the Prime Minister's official spokesman today said Tony Blair was pleased with the progress that had been made on the military, diplomatic and humanitarian fronts. 
	
	
 "The situation obviously remains fluid from hour to hour but it seems to be going in the right direction," the spokesman said. 
	
	
 The campaign so far showed Alliance military success was the best way of getting food in, he said. 
	
	
 He again stressed that Britain would need to see evidence before it became involved in military action in other countries. 
	
	
 "In terms of the war on terrorism we have always said this is a multi-faceted campaign but equally we have also said any future military action would have to be based on evidence," he said. 
	
	
 "This campaign is not over. We are still in the middle of fighting the war in Afghanistan." 
	
	
	


	
On Sunday [25 November], the Belgian Army will begin relieving its troops that are stationed in Kosovo within the scope of the NATO-led peace force (KFOR [Kosovo Force]). The replacement force will also include a Luxembourg contingent -- as has been the case since 1999 -- as well as a Romanian company including 84 troops. The army announced this on Friday [23 November]. The relief operation, which will involve some 900 troops, will begin on Saturday and last until 12 December, the Armed Forces' press service pointed out. 
	
	
	


	
BEIJING, Feb 21 (AFP) - US President George W. Bush and Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Thursday carefully played down their countries' often glaring differences over Taiwan during the US leader's visit to Beijing. 
	
	
 Both scrupulously avoided combative talk on the issue, which has been a consistent source of tension between the countries for decades. 
	
	
 Bush, who arrived in China Thursday morning, said the United States hoped for a "peaceful settlement" to tensions between China and Taiwan and stressed Washington's policy on the island had not altered. 
	
	
 "The position of my government has not changed over the years," Bush reassured his hosts. 
	
	
 "We believe in the peaceful settlement of this issue." 
	
	
 Bush reiterated his support for the Taiwan Relations Act, under which the United States is committed to providing the island with the means to defend itself. 
	
	
 But he also had a thinly veiled message for leaders in Taipei, saying "we will urge there be no provocation". 
	
	
 Bush's comments appeared designed to reassure Beijing that Washington has not shifted from its long-standing policy of avoiding making any explicit commitment to come to Taiwan's defence should China invade. 
	
	
 The tone contrasted sharply with the mood last year when Bush signed off on the biggest US arms sales to Taiwan in a decade. The sales angered Beijing and fuelled concern that Washington's tougher stance might encourage Taiwan to declare formal independence. 
	
	
 Bush's comments also pleased Taiwan's government, which pronounced itself satisfied and thanked Bush for his backing. 
	
	
 "The press conference showed the result of the discussions entirely match our forecast," said Taiwanese Foreign Minister Eugene Chien. 
	
	
 He voiced his gratitude to Bush for "having honored his commitment" made to Taipei before the Asian trip, which also took Bush to Japan and South Korea. 
	
	
 Taiwan's foreign ministry spokeswoman had said ahead of Bush's departure for Asia that Washington had assured Taipei its interests would not be harmed. 
	
	
 However some officials voiced concern that China could secure concessions on Taiwan in return for supporting Bush on issues such as anti-terrorism and prevention of nuclear arms proliferation. 
	
	
 In his comments at the press conference, Jiang also avoided areas of contention over Taiwan, which split from the mainland in 1949 after the communist victory in China's civil war. 
	
	
 "To properly handle the Taiwan question is vital to the stability and growth of China-US relations," Jiang said. 
	
	
 "In my meeting with President Bush, I have elaborated on the Chinese government's basic position of peaceful reunification and 'one country two systems' for the solution of the Taiwan question." 
	
	
 "One country two systems" is Beijing's proposal to reunify with Taiwan while allowing the island some autonomy in a similar arrangement to that which saw Hong Kong return to Chinese rule in 1997. 
	
	
 Taiwan on Thursday also called on China to reopen rapprochement talks. 
	
	
 Premier Yu Shyi-kun asked Chinese leaders to set aside differences with the island and engage in talks in the aftermath of both their entries to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). 
	
	
 Beijing has said it will not reopen talks with Taipei unless the Taiwanese government embraces its definition of "one China", under which Taiwan is considered part of its territory. 
	
	
 This is rejected by Taiwan's pro-independence President Chen Shui-bian. Dialogue across the Taiwan Straits has been frozen since he took office in May 1999. 
	
	
	


	
BETHANY - The number of illegal immigrants in Swaziland seems to be increasing. Last month members of the Umbutfo Swaziland Defence Force [USDF] found 594 illegal aliens in the country. 
	
	
 The USDF found 43 Somalians inside two kombis in Maphiveni and 23 others were found without travel documents at Matsamo border and were handed over to the Horo police. At least 507 illegal Mozambicans have been found, as well as eight South Africans, two Tanzanians, and one Burundian. 
	
	
 According to the army spokesman, Corporal Nhlanhla Dlamini, the key areas where most of the immigrants were found was Lomahasha, Mhlumeni and Sitsatsaweni. "We have discovered that there is a certain family around Lomahasha, which is suspected of assisting illegal immigrants with shelter and transport. The army would like to request whoever is engaged in this criminal activity, to stop," he said. 
	
	
 Last month, 53 cattle were also stolen around the country, of which 17 were spotted inside Mozambique driven by three men armed with rifles thought to be AK47s. The Mozambican soldiers have promised to act quickly. 
	
	
 The USDF also found four stolen cars in different places in the country. These include a Nissan Skyline in Mafutseni, a Mercedes Benz, A Toyota and an Isuzu 2.5 diesel at Nkalashane. 
	
	
	


	
TAIPEI, Feb 21 (AFP) - Taiwan Foreign Minister Eugene Chien on Thursday hailed US President George W. Bush for not trading away the island's interests to Beijing. 
	
	
 Chien said the closed-door meeting between Bush and his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin suggested there remained differences to be tackled. 
	
	
 As to the Taiwan issue, Chien said: "The press conference showed the result of the discussions entirely match our forecast..." 
	
	
 Chien voiced his gratitude to Bush for "having honored his commitment" he pledged to Taipei before his Asian trip, which also took him to Japan and South Korea. 
	
	
 Taiwan's foreign ministry spokeswoman had said ahead of Bush's departure for Asia that Washington had assured Taipei its interests would not be harmed. 
	
	
 Taiwan's foreign ministry has set up an ad hoc group to monitor the trip around-the-clock and report to President Chen Shui-bian. Taipei's de facto embassy in Washington has been given a similar task. 
	
	
 Chien said he also hoped "Washington will continue to enhance its ties with Taipei while seeking to mend fences with Beijing." 
	
	
 Bush, who arrived in China Thursday morning, said the United States hoped for a "peaceful settlement" to tensions between China and Taiwan and stressed Washington's policy on the island had not altered. 
	
	
 "The position of my government has not changed over the years," Bush said. 
	
	
 "We believe in the peaceful settlement of this issue." 
	
	
 Bush reiterated his support for the Taiwan Relations Act, under which the United States is committed to providing the island with the means to defend itself. 
	
	
 Beijing has repeatedly threatened to take Taiwan by force should the island declare formal independence. 
	
	
 In a speech to the Japanese Diet (parliament) on Tuesday, Bush said the US would continue to support its allies in the Asia Pacific region. 
	
	
 "We will continue to show American power and purpose in support of the Philippines ... Australia ... and Thailand ... America will remember our commitments to the people on Taiwan," he said, without elaborating. 
	
	
 
	
	
	


	
US President Bush, after visiting Japan and South Korea, will follow with a visit to China. Whether Bush will, like Clinton, damage Taiwan's interests is receiving the deep concern of all quarters. The protection of Taiwan's interests under the US-Japan alliance structure is fairly strong. Before President Bush visits China, Japanese naval strategy expert Kawamura Sumihiko and missile expert Sato Mamoru were exclusively interviewed by a reporter of this newspaper. They reiterated the importance of Taiwan's strategic position and at the same time put forward their views with regard to the situation in the Taiwan Strait. 
	
	
 Kawamura: Japan and Taiwan are both exporting nations. Stable ocean traffic is an absolute necessity. Last year, approximately 5.1 billion tons of goods passed through the world's oceans, about one third of which passed through the sea areas of southern China. Half of this one third was transported to Japan through the sea areas near Taiwan. The traffic on Taiwan's seas is extremely important to Japan. If Taiwan becomes a part of China, all of Taiwan's sea areas will be threatened. China is currently in the process of actively expanding as a maritime nation. Its purpose is to ensure resources and the lives of a population of 1.5 billion people. However, China is not a nation that is able to abide by international rules, and for this reason, there will inevitably be conflicts on the ocean. Under these circumstances, Taiwan and Japan both must recognize clearly the important role of the navy. 
	
	
 Question: What is your appraisal of Taiwan's navy? 
	
	
 Kawamura: Frankly speaking, Taiwan's navy is worrisome. Anti-submarine combat strength is extremely low, and in particular there are many old style naval aircraft that, compared to Japan, are possibly 30 to 40 years behind. Torpedo strength is also insufficient. The Navy's problems are very large. For example, there is only one submarine attached to each naval base. It can only be said that this is nothing more than an embellishment and fundamentally cannot accomplish anything. Taiwan should make an all out effort to augment naval combat strength. In past Taiwan-US arms sale negotiations, the PC-3 early warning aircraft and the MH53 helicopter that Taiwan has made requests to purchase are entirely suitable to Taiwan's needs. The PC-3's intelligence exchange system is extremely important and is not inferior to the Aegis destroyer. 
	
	
 Question: Will the United States sell Aegis destroyers to Taiwan? 
	
	
 Kawamura: One of the reasons that the United States has all along not provided Aegis destroyers to Taiwan is that in the past the United States considered Taiwan's armed forces to be the armed forces of the Nationalist Party, not the armed forces of the nation. Nationalization of the armed forces after Lee Teng-hui (Li Teng-hui) and the loyal attitude of the armed forces after Chen Shui-bian (Ch'en Shui-pien) came into office have already gradually allowed the United States to feel at ease. Although Japan and the United States haven't recognized it, in reality, the United States, Japan and Taiwan currently are already situated in a kind of virtual alliance. I reckon that at the last stage, the United States will provide the Aegis destroyer to Taiwan. It is not possible that the Republican Party will get along with China, Taiwan can again wait for a little while. 
	
	
 Question: Where is China's true threat to Taiwan 
	
	
 Sato: China's threat to Taiwan is the use of the three methods of missiles, amphibious landing, and submarine blockades. The most likely method is to use missiles to threaten Taiwan psychologically. 
	
	
 Question: How should Taiwan respond to China's missile threat? 
	
	
 Sato: I gave a speech on this issue in Taiwan. Taiwan has some people who very obviously purposely play up China's use of force to scare Taiwan. In 1996, the Chinese People's Liberation Army indeed fired four missiles near Taiwan, but this was a kind of propaganda war. Before the United States attacked Afghanistan, it first explained the reasons to every nation of the world, and China using missiles to attack Taiwan is certainly not simple. If China only uses common warheads, at most, it would only make a few holes in Taiwan. If warheads with biological weapons are used, China has no means to justify this to international public opinion. During the Second World War, Germany fired 7,000 V1 and V2 missiles at England and England did not surrender. Recently, old Yugoslavia fired 3,000 missiles at Kosovo and Kosovo also did not surrender. This is an issue of will. 
	
	
 Question: What is the significance for Taiwan of the United States and Japan jointly researching TMD theater missile defense system technology? 
	
	
 Sato: After the 9-11 incident, the United States will be even keener on developing TMD. Taiwan is also very important to the United States, especially Taiwan's strategic position. The possibility of the TMD anti-missile system covering Taiwan in the future is very great. Currently, Taiwan's Patriot missiles are effective against guided missiles. I reckon that the probability of war occurring between China and Taiwan is smaller than small. Not using peaceful methods to resolve the Taiwan issue won't do, and I reckon that the US-Japan summit talks will discuss the issue of the two shores. 
	
	
 However, Taiwan announcing independence to the outside world is a variable. Taiwan announcing independence is not itself a problem, but because Taiwan announcing independence would bring unrest and a domino effect would occur with regard to Tibet and Xinjiang, this is China's greatest fear. There would be no difference between Taiwan announcing independence to the outside world and the current situation. Taiwan has no need to announce independence, and there won't be any problem if only the name "Taiwan" is used.

 One in four children in the KwaZulu-Natal capital of Pietermaritzburg has been orphaned by Aids, and the number is set to rocket in the next 10 years. 
	
	
 A study by Dr Neil McKerrow, chief paediatrician at Pietermaritzburg's Metropolitan Hospitals Complex, shows that 50 000 Aids orphans live in the city. The number rises to 100 000 if surrounding areas in the Midlands are included. 
	
	
 McKerrow estimates that the number of orphans in the Midlands will top 250 000 by 2010. 
	
	
 His figures refer to children under 16 who have lost their mothers, in line with a World Health Organisation definition. According to Statistics SA, the city has 193 000 children in that age group out of a total population of 573 000. 
	
	
 Although there are care centres and orphanages in Pietermaritzburg, McKerrow's study found that extended families and the community were willing to take in these children. 
	
	
 Six years ago McKerrow and a colleague at the Edendale Hospital, Annelise Verbeek, pioneered a study entitled Models of Care for Children in Distress, a term they coined for abandoned, displaced and orphaned children in the region. 
	
	
 They found that 6% of children in Pietermaritzburg were Aids orphans. Six years later, the number has risen to 25%. 
	
	
 At an informal meeting three weeks ago, the city council was told that, according to estimates from teachers, there were now as many as 100 000 Aids orphans in the city, but city health officials say these numbers appear to be too high. 
	
	
 McKerrow's estimates are based on household counts coupled with mathematical models used by the WHO. 
	
	
 KwaZulu-Natal has the highest rate of HIV infection in SA, with 36% of the population infected. McKerrow estimates there are 4.6 million orphans countrywide. 
	
	
 Yvonne Spain, the co-ordinator of Children In Distress, a network of more than 50 organisations and people, said communities were absorbing the children, "but the fact of the matter is that, as multiple deaths occur, that safety net will fall apart". 
	
	
 The director of the provincial Aids Action Unit, Dr Sandile Buthelezi, admitted the city faced "quite a problem" and suggested this week the figures might even be higher than McKerrow's. 
	
	
 He said: "The number of orphans is not a static thing. . . Every day an orphan is being created and I know the problem is enormous in the province." 
	
	
 Buthelezi said the provincial health department was working closely with the welfare community and the private sector to secure funding for bodies working with Aids orphans.	


	
JOHANNESBURG Feb 12 Sapa ALLEGED ISRAELI MAFIA MEMBER TO STAND TRIAL IN AUGUST 
	
	
 Alleged Israeli mafia member Lior Saad will stand trial in August for the murder of the estranged husband of a close friend of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. 
	
	
 The Johannesburg Magistrate's Court ruled on Tuesday Saad would stand trial from August 12 to 30 for the murder of diamond merchant Shai Avissar, who disappeared in 1999. 
	
	
 Avissar's body was found in a shallow grave on a smallholding near Pretoria on October 17, 1999. 
	
	
 The diamond merchant was married to Hazel Crane, a close friend of Madikizela-Mandela. 
	
	
 Saad will remain in custody until the trial.

 Tokyo, Jan. 17 Kyodo -- Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who just completed a whirlwind tour of five Southeast Asian nations, said Thursday he longed for more leisurely trips -- but added that may have to wait until he leaves his post. 
	
	
 "I would like to visit various countries at a more leisurely pace -- meet with the people of the land and travel not only to the capital but also to rural cities for sightseeing," the premier told a gathering in Tokyo. 
	
	
 "But when I think of my duties as prime minister, I can't visit one country and not go to the other, or stay in one country for three days and stay in the other for only a day. If I am to visit several countries in a limited time, it is always one or two days at best," he said. 
	
	
 "Of course, if I step down as prime minister, I can visit one country for a week each," he said. 
	
	
 But the premier also said that although short, he thinks his visits to the countries are still meaningful. 
	
	
 "There is a saying, seeing is believing. Even if it's only for a day or two, it is significant to visit a country and exchange views with the people of the country in person," he said. 
	
	
 Koizumi made a weeklong tour of the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore earlier in the month. He stayed for less than a day in most countries.	


	
Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- China urged the United States on Thursday to abide by the "one China policy", warning that any act to trample upon the Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques could result in a "very unfavorable" impact on relations between the two countries. 
	
	
 The question of Taiwan, which relates to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, is an essential and most important issue and is at the heart of Sino-U.S. relations, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue. 
	
	
 China hopes the United States will not do anything against the spirit of the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques, she said. 
	
	
 Zhang made the remarks at a news briefing in response to a question about the Taiwan official Tang Yiau-min's recent visit to the United States. 
	
	
 Zhang replied that Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing has put forward China's stand on the matter while making strong representations to the U.S. government with the hope that the United States treats the matter seriousness it deserves. 
	
	
 She said during the U.S. President Bush's working visit to China last month, state leaders of both countries agreed that Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Hu Jintao would visit the United States this year. 
	
	
 However, within one month of Bush's visit, the U.S. has already done several things which are against the spirit of the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques. 
	
	
 Zhu said the U.S. side should stop interfering in China's internal affairs by interfering in the Taiwan issue. 
	
	
	


	
KHARTOUM, Feb 13 (AFP) - Sudanese rebels have released a group of fishermen they had held for the last six months after charging that their boat belonged to the Sudanese government army, their employer said Wednesday. 
	
	
 Salmah Trading and Investment Company said its fishermen, who were captured last August while fishing in the Fangak area in south Sudan's Upper Nile region, were set free Tuesday by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). 
	
	
 "The release was due to tremendous efforts by the citizens who benefit from the company's services," the company said in a statement received by AFP, without elaborating further. The statement did not indicate the exact number of the freed fishermen but an official of the company said they were originally 11 in number. 
	
	
 The Sudanese government had always denied that the boat belonged to the army. The rebels released the boat shortly after the fishermen were captured. 
	
	
 The private trading company said in its statement that it would continue with its services "for the benefit of the people of southern Sudan." 
	
	
 Sudan's civil war has raged since 1983 when the SPLA took up arms in a bid to end domination of the mainly Christian and animist south by the Islamic government in the north.	


	
The Argentine TV station Todo Noticias ["All News"] reported yesterday that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Saturday night telephoned Cordoba Province Governor Jose Manuel de la Sota, of the Justicialist Party (PJ) -- who once served as ambassador to Brazil -- to voice his concern over incidents in the country. 
	
	
 "Cardoso told De la Sota that the images of the protests at the Plaza de Mayo show a country on the verge of a civil war," one of the channel's journalists commented. 
	
	
 According to the reporter, the Brazilian president apparently advised De la Sota to move forward the elections, initially slated for March 2002. But neither Itamaraty nor the Planalto Palace confirmed the president's phone call to the governor of Cordoba. 
	
	
 Legislators Request Action from the Brazilian Government 
	
	
 Concern has spread to Brazilian legislators. Violent attacks at the Argentine legislature sounded alarm bells in the Brazilian political arena, to the point that senators of the official and opposition parties defended more concrete support from the Brazilian Government for Argentina. Deputy Jose Genoino (Workers Party -- Sao Paulo) said that the wave of looting threatens Argentine democracy. He asked that Brazil promote meetings in the South American continent, or serve as intermediary in negotiations with international institutions. 
	
	
 "This is an unpredictable, anarchical situation. We don't know where it will go, against whom. It is dangerous! In addition to Argentina there are other countries in crisis, such as Colombia and Venezuela. We have a very risky scenario. Any step backward for democracy on the continent would be a disaster. Brazil cannot stand by with its hands folded just watching all of this," Genoino affirmed. 
	
	
 PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] President Jose Anibal (Sao Paulo) said that Cardoso has already placed himself at the disposal of the Argentine Government to talk to international financial institutions. He noted, "Brazil should adopt an open posture with relation to Argentina, which is experiencing a tragedy." 
	
	
 For Jose Agripino Maia, PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader in the Senate, although Brazil has detached itself from Argentina, it should not disregard the message of the crises that is devastating the neighboring country. 
	
	
 "The political warning must be heeded. Either one pays attention to the will of the people or what happened will happen." Maia commented. 
	
	
 Senator Heloisa Helena (Workers Party -- Alagoas) said that Latin American countries should always join together to speak with international economic institutions, in order to maintain autonomy in their economies: "Now we see what happens when one country abdicates its financial autonomy. I hope that this can alert the Brazilian Government to revise its relationship with the IMF." 
	
	
 Analysts: Lack of Alternative for Power 
	
	
 Political scientists agree: Argentina lacks a political force that can stand up to Peronism and Radicalism. This is viewed as the main impediment to the establishment of political order in the country. USP [University of Sao Paulo] professor Emir Sader believes that Peronists will remain in power after the elections, slowly growing weaker, allowing room for the emergence of new leadership. 
	
	
 "The degree of pauperization will be brutal. Everything depends on how long it takes for Peronism to burn out and new leadership to emerge," Sader said. 
	
	
 For the political scientist, Argentina cannot wait for assistance from the American Government. Latin America is no longer important because the focus now is on global security and no longer on the international economic order. 
	
	
 Sader affirmed, "The new policy of (US President George W.) Bush is to permit decay. The concern now is security. All eyes are on Pakistan, China, and Russia." 
	
	
	


	
China has launched three unmanned spacecraft consecutively and exhibited to the world the capsules recovered. People have seen the true features of these space capsules. What exactly then is a manned spaceship? 
	
	
 It is learned that the manned spaceship will have a liftoff weight of about eight tonnes, and is less than 10 meters long and 3.5 meters in diameter. It can carry two to three astronauts and continue to cruise in space for more than 20 days. 
	
	
 The spaceship has been designed with comprehensive reference to the Russian spaceship Soyuz. The spaceship is composed of three cylindrical capsules, with the orbiter capsule fitted on the forefront. Its interior is equipped with corresponding facilities for space observation and space drug and microgravity tests. The return capsule, connected to the orbiter capsule, is the cockpit of the astronauts and the only capsule that will reenter the atmosphere for landing. Three reclining seats will be installed in the capsule for astronauts. Instrument panel, control shaft, and optical telescope will be installed below the seats. At the rear of the spaceship is the propulsion capsule to provide thrust to the spaceship in orbital control and return to earth. In accordance with the plan, China's manned spaceship will conduct a series of scientific tests and earth observation after it is launched into space. 
	
	
 Space technology will not only be used for civilian, but also for military purposes, and there is no exception for China. It is speculated that the spaceship will almost certainly be equipped with facilities relating to military observation and attack on enemy satellites. Therefore, the manned spaceflight will enable China to have preliminary space combat capability. 
	
	
 According to the experience of the United States and Russia, one of the greatest problems of manned spaceship is inadequate power supply. The solar energy batteries usually cannot meet the needs of numerous equipment on a spaceship. However, it is understood that China has successfully resolved this problem to provide sufficient power supply for its spaceship. After completing the orbital flight, the spaceship will adjust itself to the return position by following ground command and ignite the engine to change to the orbit for returning to the earth. Before gliding into the atmosphere, the orbiter and propulsion capsules will be discarded. 
	
	
 By referring to the designs of the Russia spaceship Soyuz, it is very possible that China will apply the lift control technology in its manned spaceship. This technology will enable the spaceship to limit its mobility in the atmosphere. In the altitude of about several thousands of meters, the return capsule will eject the parachutes to further reduce the speed. It is reported that in the past China's recovery site for returning satellites was in the mountains of Sichuan Province. 
	
	
 To facilitate recovery and rescue in future manned spaceflight, the recovery site will be located in sparsely populated grassland or the wilderness. Judging from the selection of recovery sites for the two previous flights, the site for recovering the manned spaceship may be situated in the grassland of Inner Mongolia. 
	
	
 The next step after the land recovery, China may change to recovering the manned spaceship on the sea. 
	
	
 An informed source has said that it can be seen that the designs for China's manned spaceflight have taken into consideration future modifications. For the next flight, the top of the spaceship's orbiter capsule may be installed with a docking module for docking tests between two spaceships. The concerned person said that this is a prelude to China's space station development plan.	


	
Lugano, 8 Jan -- Spanish-Israeli businessman Felipe Turover has denounced the Swiss in front of the European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg for having put his life in danger in its case against [Secretary of the Russian-Belarus Union] Pavel Borodin, former Kremlin senior aid accused of money laundering, according to a communique Tuesday from his lawyer Niccolo Salvioni. 
	
	
 According to the communique, received at the Swiss news agency ATS, the 37-year-old M. Turover --considered by the Swiss courts as a key witness -- had asked the Swiss Government and the Swiss Public Ministry that he be put under protection, believing himself threatened by the Russian Mafia because of leaks by Swiss court officials. 
	
	
 Pavel Borodin, the former property manager of the Kremlin, is suspected of having laundered some $25 million in secret commissions which came from two Swiss companies headquartered in the Tessin (southeast) region -- Mercata, and Mabetex -- in exchange for being awarded the contracts for the renovation of the Kremlin and the Russian presidential aircraft in 1995 and 1996. 
	
	
 At the end of June 2001, the Swiss Public Ministry rejected a complaint from Turover against a former Ministry official, Carla Del Ponte -- today a lawyer with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) -- in which Turover accused her of putting his life in danger during this case; in November the rejection was upheld by the Federal Tribunal, which is Switzerland's highest court. 
	
	
 Turover accused Mme. Del Ponte of having furnished -- in 1999 when she headed the Swiss Public Ministry -- confidential information to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera which made numerous revelations about the Mabetex-Borodin affair, including the existence of credit cards in the name of the Yeltsin family. The newspaper presented Turover as a key informer in this affair and the Spanish-Israeli businessman affirmed that these leaks had put his life in danger. 
	
	
 Today, Turover is accusing the Swiss authorities of having violated on several occasions the European Convention on Human Rights. The communique from his lawyer affirms that the Swiss authorities, the Federal Tribunal, and the Swiss Public Ministry "have given proof of illegality and political persecution." 
	
	
 Mabetex, a construction company, is suspected of having landed public contracts for renovating the Kremlin and other Russian official buildings by offering bribes worth a dozen million dollars in 1995 and 1996 to close associates of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, including to Borodin. 
	
	
 At the request of the Geneva court, Borodin was arrested in the United States January 17, 2001. He agreed to be extradited to Switzerland April 7th. After six days in preventive detention, he was released on bail for $3 million. 
	
	
	


	
A cargo ship intercepted in the Channel after a tip-off that it might be carrying terrorist materials was today given the all clear, police said. 
	
	
 The 450ft long vessel Nisha, carrying 26,000 tonnes [metric tons] of raw sugar, was stopped on Friday morning [21 December] amid fears it could be transporting noxious, hazardous or dangerous substances. 
	
	
 But after a detailed examination of the ship, which is currently moored off the Isle of Wight, nothing suspicious was found, police said. 
	
	
 Assistant Commissioner David Veness, head of Scotland Yard's specialist operations, said: "New information, combined with the relentless efforts of scientific experts, our detailed knowledge of the ship and its movements, and very careful examination of the vessel over the last three days leads us to be completely satisfied that the Nisha is not a suspicious vessel and does not pose a danger." 
	
	
 The Nisha was halted by anti-terrorist police, the Royal Navy and Customs and Excise officials after a tip-off that it contained "terrorist material" and the Royal Navy frigate HMS Sutherland intercepted her in international waters, about 30 miles south of Beachy Head. 
	
	
 The MV Nisha is operated by the Great Eastern Shipping Company, based in Bombay, India. 
	
	
 It had recently stopped in the east African country of Djibouti, a neighbour of Somalia, which has been linked to Usama Bin Ladin's al Qa'ida terror network. 
	
	
 The ship had sailed from Mauritius and was carrying a cargo of sugar to the Tate &amp;amp; Lyle refinery on the Thames at Silvertown in east London, according to the company. 
	
	
 Police had earlier indicated they expected the search to take a number of weeks, because of the vessel's size and design, but experts completed the job today. 
	
	
 Anti-terrorist officers said they were also satisfied that the ship's crew and owners had not committed any offence. 
	
	
 Mr Veness said the ship was now in a position to continue its journey, but completion of the voyage was still subject to consultation with all interested parties. 
	
	
 He added: "We have not detected any signs of interference and we do not believe that the seals of the holds have been interfered with. 
	
	
 "We had anticipated that detailed examination of the ship might take rather longer. This was to ensure that there was no chance of risk to the public. 
	
	
 "The cargo ship Nisha was intercepted and boarded as part of an intelligence-led operation. 
	
	
 "This was the right and proper course of action to take. Thankfully, the ship has been proved not to pose a danger to the public." 
	
	
 Mr Veness praised the crew and ship's owners for their co-operation and said: "We remain vigilant and are totally committed to ensuring the safety of the public. 
	
	
 "We would take similar action in the future if there was a potential risk to the public." 
	
	
 The Nisha's cargo of raw sugar is owned by the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate, which had chartered the vessel, and the vessel was due to dock in east London yesterday. 
	
	
 The chairman of the British arm of the Great Eastern Shipping Company, Sudhir Mulji, confirmed that the vessel had stopped over at Djibouti before its current journey to drop off American grain as part of a food aid shipment. 
	
	
 The ship then went on to Mauritius to pick up the sugar and left on November 20 to transport it to Britain. 
	
	
 The Great Eastern Shipping Company, which has offices in India, London, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, is a leading Indian shipping and offshore service provider with a fleet of 38 cargo-carrying vessels.	


	
COOLUM, Australia, March 3 (AFP) -- Hopes of a breakthrough in the Commonwealth's bitter deadlock over Zimbabwe rose Sunday as Canada sought to resolve the row after African nations accused Britain of neo-colonialism. 
	
	
 Political violence in the lead up to Zimbabwe's elections next weekend again overshadowed the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) during a second day of crunch talks here. 
	
	
 Britain and Australia have abandoned their push to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth before the March 9-10 elections in face of increasingly angry opposition led by Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania. 
	
	
 But Britain still wants sanctions imposed if Commonwealth monitors find evidence of ballot rigging. 
	
	
 They believe the credibility of the Commonwealth will be severely damaged if there is no decisive action. 
	
	
 British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday that if President Robert Mugabe won and it were clear he had won by fraud, then he had no doubt Zimbabwe would be suspended. 
	
	
 "I mean, if there wasn't (suspension) in these circumstances, the Commonwealth would be badly damaged," he warned. 
	
	
 However, Zimbabwe's minister of state for information, Jonathan Mayo, accused Blair of leading a "racist" campaign against its former colony and lashed out at his attacks on Mugabe as "thoroughly disgraceful and unacceptable". 
	
	
 "What we do in Zimbabwe as an independent sovereign state is in accordance with our constitution and our laws," Moyo told reporters. 
	
	
 He also claimed the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was a British sponsored candidate. 
	
	
 Tanzania's President Benjamin Mkapa earlier told journalists in a stout and rare public defence of Mugabe, that even discussing the situation at the Coolum talks threatened the "prerogative and sovereign right of the people of Zimbabwe to make an unfettered choice of their leader and government". 
	
	
 "How does it (the Commonwealth) handle Zimbabwe? Why should it handle Zimbabwe?", Mkapa said, railing at what is being perceived as interference in another country's internal affairs. 
	
	
 But proposals involving a timetable for the imposition of post-election sanctions put forward by Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien to the leaders' retreat provided the first sign of a possible breakthrough. 
	
	
 "Everybody has agreed that nothing will be done before the elections", Chretien told reporters here Sunday, adding a communique would be issued Monday. 
	
	
 "The Canadian position was that the elections will occur a week from now and that we have observers there. We have to wait until the elections are over before concluding." 
	
	
 He said the formula proposed by Canada would include "a mechanism for a quick decision" once the results of the elections are known, but would not be drawn further. 
	
	
 It is believed that the proposal calls for a report from observers within two weeks of the elections, and a decision to be made in full on whether to impose sanctions within four weeks. 
	
	
 Mugabe has reportedly told Blair "to keep your pink nose out of our affairs," the Sun-Herald reported here Sunday. 
	
	
 "Go to hell," said Mugabe. "Our people have decided and that is what matters to us. It's not their (Britain's) right or responsibility to decide on our elections." 
	
	
 Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told Australian television Sunday there was some sympathy for Mugabe's comments among African leaders, whose countries were once part of the British empire. 
	
	
 "There is still that very strong sense that Britain and other countries (are) sometimes being neo-colonialist." 
	
	
 The 54-nation Commonwealth is one of the few organisations to have observers on the ground in Zimbabwe in the run-up to elections in which the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) led by Tsvangirai is challenging Mugabe's 22-year rule. 
	
	
 The issue has threatened to fracture the organisation along rich/poor, black/white lines, despite calls from its head, Queen Elizabeth II, in her opening address Saturday to work to bridge cultural differences. 
	
	
 Several Asian nations have privately said they would also oppose sanctions. 
	
	
 Fijian Foreign Minister Kaliopate Tavola told journalists that as a nation which has suffered Commonwealth sanctions, Fiji believed they were the wrong way to go. 
	
	
 Fiji was only readmitted to the Commonwealth in January after being expelled following the 2000 coup.
