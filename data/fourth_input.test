	
During the past weeks Europe and America witnessed the arrangement of important international conferences, which could on the one hand guarantee the peace and stability of the world, or could instead deteriorate the conditions. The conference in New York, which dealt with a ban on demand for light arms, and the Genoa Conference which had a much wider and extended agenda, had two common features between them. The first was that large and numerous bodies of dissidents were opposing the wishes and interests of a small but powerful group. The second feature was that both conferences ended without effective result, and the decisions taken and resolutions adopted there lacked conclusiveness and were not operational. The Bonn Conference however, which dealt with the global environment and examined the condition of world climate, could be appraised as an exception and a relative success. 
	
	
 After two weeks of discussion and exchange of views at the New York Conference, it was decided to pay heed to the resolute demands advanced by the majority of the participants, who emphatically insisted on the imposition of a ban on the sale of light weaponry. But paying heed was not tantamount to endorsement of the demand launched by those countries; rather, the final result came out as a compromise solution and a relative back up by the majority group. 
	
	
 The joint demand and stand by the majority of countries attending the conference was encountered by firm opposition by the United States [of America]. American delegates at the conference maintained that any restriction or ban on the sale, possession, and carrying of light armaments was practically the same as limiting the freedom of action [as published] of American citizens, and equal to reducing their margin of security. This is while possessing arms for self-defense is itself a factor that breeds insecurity. Critics of the meeting, on the margin of the conference, up held the view that the American government, instead of heeding the wishes of international community, and protecting the security of world nations, and above all the safety of its own citizens, has paid more attention to the interests of corporations and huge arms producers and military-industrial complexes that reap tremendous profits annually from the sale of such armaments. (It should be noted that the issues moved at the conference were declared unofficial and lacking validity [legal force] even for the participating countries.) [Sentences are as published] The most important of the three conferences, which subsequently gained even more prominence, was the conference in Genova; perhaps even more so for the results "not obtained" at the conference, and which led to the subsequent intense dissatisfaction and frustration of the leading industrial states attending the meeting. The governments attending the conference had a long and varied agenda, including: economic globalization, the anti-missile shield defense project, the Kyoto Protocol and environmental protection, the political and military crises in the Middle East, the Balkans, and Afghanistan, moratorium on the accumulated debt of the poor countries, and ... [as published] They meant to reach some form of agreement or understanding about those issues, but unexpected events left all that in limbo and uncertainty. The conference opened with fierce demonstrations by the opponents of economic globalization, who maintained that what is being concocted by globalization is in fact poverty. When Italian police intervened and roughly handled the demonstrations, things got out of hand; the already volatile situation reached boiling point, violent clashes broke out, and the killing of one protestor overshadowed all other issues. The whole incident was in fact unprecedented in the history of European democracies, and has prompted a whole range of controversies and debates. 
	
	
 It can safely be claimed that the events in Genoa have influenced [overshadowed] the very conferences in New York and Bonn; whereas, from the onset, the weak results of Genoa was foreseeable for most observers. Because, from the very start it could be predicted that on the subject of economic globalization, the developed and capitalist states were going to come across fierce opposition by dissident groups and the supporters of economic growth in poor countries. 
	
	
 Regarding the American proposed Anti-Missile Defense System too, neither Russia, China, Japan, nor even the European Union, had shown any enthusiasm; rather they had all expressed their reserves on the project. Concerning the environmental protection issue, the emission of toxic and greenhouse gases, and warming up of the planet earth's climate too, which was somehow related to the [agenda of] Bonn Conference, America had relentlessly demonstrated its paradoxical [as published] [controversial] position and particular stance opposed to that of other developed states by her previous abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol. Whereas, beforehand, it was anticipated and hoped that the agreements reached at Genoa would help bring about beneficial results for the Bonn conference as well. Even the eagerness for playing an intermediary role in the Middle East crisis has given rise to fierce competition between America, European Union, and Russia and China. And it is likely that until each party seeks its own particular interest in the conflict, and until the rivalry persists, the question would continue to remain unresolved. 
	
	
 What, however, was most remarkable in the conferences in New York and Genoa, was the fact that most decisions made, were based on interests and tastes of particular groups [lobbies]. Here are the views expressed by two of the prominent characters attending the Genoa Conference. Jacques Chirac, the French President, responding to the protests leveled by opponents of globalization, had said: "They have no right to present themselves as defenders of the world poor..." Similarly, Gerhard Schroeder, the German Chancellor, too had claimed that the participants at the summit meeting were the true, legitimate, and elected representatives of the people of their countries. In the remarks made by these political leaders, one point is interesting and calls for reflection: if these leaders reject the interference of others in the condition and destiny of the poor nations, while present themselves legitimate and competent to make far reaching decisions for them, then it must be said that they are only the elected [leaders] of their own nation [people], and this does not entitle them to act as representative or legal attorney of all people worldwide! [Exclamation mark as published] In view of the criticisms, which have been made, they could perhaps be also considered to be the representative of powerful corporations that have placed the whole "world economy" under their influence, and as a result of that they are also controlling the world of politics globally. 
	
	
 At the Bonn Conference too, the agenda was to tackle and discuss the most urgent and indispensable factors concerning the life of humankind. The remarkable feature of this conference was the joint resolution adopted by 180 countries worldwide --- in regard to protection of environment, and above all reducing the emission of greenhouse gases ---, which has isolated America in an undeniable way. It was due to this isolation that America, in spite of discrediting [undermining] the Kyoto Protocol and declining to comply with the Bonn Conference [resolution], was forced to at least make a promise to cooperate in preventing an increase in air pollution. 
	
	
 To recap, if there ever existed any possibility that at the conferences of New York and Genoa questions regarding: promotion of world security, improvement of economic conditions, defusing regional and global crises and conflicts, checking unleashed competition for rearmament, reduction of the gap between the mainstream and peripheral countries, and ... could be addressed and appropriate, serious, and worthy measures for their solution could be adopted, the opportunity was very easily lost and the meetings flopped completely. As regards the recent conference (Bonn Meeting), although the past gatherings like the Hague meeting and Kyoto conference have proved to be failed experiences, nevertheless as the climatic and atmospheric crises are growing more serious, one can be optimistic and hopeful about the success of such protocols and pacts, and implementation of the agreements, even though they are not protected by any sanctions.

KINSHASA, July 14 (AFP) - Some 60 representatives of civil society, parties, rebel groups and government in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are to take part in preparatory talks on reviving political dialogue in the vast country next month, an official said Saturday. 
	
	
 A representative of the facilitator of the talks, Hacen Ould Lebatt, told a media conference here that 38 civil society delegates, representing seven of the DRC's 11 provinces, had already been designated. 
	
	
 The round of consultations ahead of the start of formal negotiations between the various parties -- dubbed the "inter-Congolese dialogue" -- will begin August 20 in the Botswana capital Gaborone, the facilitator of the talks, former Botswana president Ketumile Masire, announced this week. 
	
	
 Masire's team, which has criss-crossed the former Zaire to prepare for the talks, is currently pursuing its mission in the provinces of Bandundu, Bas-Congo, Equateur, and in the capital Kinshasa, Lebatt said. 
	
	
 Masire said this week he was determined to "ensure that people from all corners of the country are allowed to express their views", adding that he wanted to avoid a "superficial" exercise. 
	
	
 The national dialogue is a feature of peace accords signed in 1999 by all warring parties in the former Zaire -- two rebel groups, their backers Rwanda and Uganda, and the Kinshasa government and its allies, Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia. 
	
	
 Masire was brought back into the DRC peace process in February this year as facilitator for the inter-Congolese dialogue by President Joseph Kabila. 
	
	
 The young president's father Laurent, assassinated in January, had sidelined Masire after accusing him of being biased in favour of the rebels. 
	
	
 Lebatt told the media conference that deep divergences remained concerning the designation of delegates to represent DRC political parties, and those to represent the parties who signed the Lusaka agreement. 
	
	
 "The political players must overcome their divisions by finding a formula for consensus," said Lebatt, who is former foreign and cooperation minister of Mauritania. 
	
	
 The Lusaka accord merely speaks about "political opposition", he said. "One must ask 'opposition to whom and what?'." 
	
	
 Lebatt said the facilitation team expected to draw up a final list of participants by August 6. 
	
	
 The conflict in the former Zaire broke out when rebels backed by Laurent Kabila's erstwhile allies Rwanda and Uganda launched an insurgency in August 1998. 
	
	
	


	
Russian guards seize 87 kg of heroin on Tajik-Afghan border 
	
	
 Text of report in English by Russian news agency ITAR-TASS 
	
	
 Dushanbe, 21 July: A patrol of Russia's border guards discovered two sacks filled with narcotics on the Moskva border detachment's section of the Tajik-Afghan border on Friday [20 July]. An expert examination showed that the sacks contained 86.9 kilos of pure heroin, head of the press service of Russia's Border Troops in Tajikistan Colonel Aleksandr Kondratyev told ITAR-TASS on Saturday. Drug dealers have lost some 3,600 kilos of narcotics including more than a tonne of heroin on the Tajik-Afghan border since the beginning of the year, the colonel said. During the year 2000 border guards confiscated 2,950 kilos of drugs, including 670 kilos of heroin, Kondratyev noted.

 Paris, July 11 (CNA) -- Taiwan's economy will become totally dependent on mainland China within the next few years, causing the island to lose control of its own political fate, a French weekly warned Thursday. 
	
	
 The Nouvel Observateur said that Beijing is unlikely to annex Taiwan by force, despite its deployment of missiles along its coastal provinces opposite Taiwan, but is instead resorting to smarter tactics, bringing the Taiwan authorities to heel through Taiwan businessmen who are eager to explore the mainland Chinese market. 
	
	
 The weekly said that mainland China has attracted more than US$50 billion in investment from Taiwan thus far, while the Taipei authorities bowed to pressure from its own businessmen to lift restrictions on investment in mainland China in May, a move expected to speed up the flow of Taiwan capital to its arch rival. 
	
	
 Barring any reversal to the trend, the weekly quoted U.S. magazine Business Weekly as saying that Beijing might bring the island to its knees without firing one bullet. 
	
	
 Another factor which might deter Beijing's military adventurism in the Taiwan Strait is Washington's "readiness to fight Beijing for Taiwan," which will bear witness to Washington's determination to remain a power in Asia, according to the magazine. 
	
	
 The publication quoted Wu Guoguang, a professor at Hong Kong University, as saying that any concessions by Washington on the Taiwan issue could trigger a defection of its Asian allies, including Japan, to Beijing's fold. 
	
	
 But Beijing's leaders are not likely to blink on the issue either because an independent state in Taiwan would boost the schisms in Tibet and Xinjiang and threaten the regime in Beijing, the magazine claimed. 
	
	
 Although there is only scant possibility of a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the Nouvel Observateur said, Beijing's military buildup in its southern coastal provinces still makes the region "the most heavily armed place in the world next only to the Middle East," and a dangerous flashpoint in the 21st century.	


	
Beijing, July 17 (XINHUA)-- DaimlerChrysler AG said Monday that the international recall of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars did not affect vehicle owners in China. 
	
	
 A written statement made by the company's China branch revealed that no glitches had been found in China since its last recall in 1999, Tuesday's China Daily reported. 
	
	
 The Germany-based auto giant recalled 150,000 Mercedes-Benz luxury cars throughout Europe and the Middle East on Friday to fix a defect that could cause the driver's side air bag to deploy prematurely, the newspaper said. 
	
	
 The recall conducted in China in 1999 was purely a precautionary measure and no reports of any incidents in China had been received at that time, China Daily quoted the statement as saying. 
	
	
 The exclusion of China from the recall has led to claims that the firm was biased against Chinese customers. The China Consumers Association said Monday that it had received five complaints of problems related with Benz cars in China, according to China Daily. 
	
	
 The problem was first discovered in March 1996 in Indonesia and led to a November 1999 recall of cars in the United States and Asia, where hot, humid conditions were thought to trigger the air bags. 
	
	
	


	
BRUSSELS, June 29 (AFP) -- Nearly 100 donor countries and international organizations opened their checkbooks here Friday to bail out struggling Yugoslavia after Slobodan Milosevic's lightning transfer to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
	
	
 "Nobody is happy when a former president is taken before the tribunal in The Hague, but it had to happen and the sooner the better," Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus told reporters on his arrival here. 
	
	
 The donors' conference, co-sponsored by the European Commission and the World Bank, was hoping to raise 1.25 billion dollars (1.47 billion euros) for Yugoslavia this year for urgent repairs to infrastructure and salaries to teachers and other civil servants. 
	
	
 By midday, the conference had garnered pledges totalling some 1.37 billion dollars in grants and low- or no-interest loans over the next three years, against the target figure set by the World Bank of 3.9 billion dollars for what Belgrade would need for the three-year period. 
	
	
 The European Commission anounced it had pledged a financial package of grants and loans totalling 530 million euros (450 million dollars). 
	
	
 "This pledge is in addition to the pledges of individual EU member states that will be made separately at the conference," said Gunnar Wiegand, spokesman for External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten. 
	
	
 Labus said the United States, which had until the last minute been uncertain of attending the conference, contingent on Milosevic's extradition, pledged 181.6 million dollars during the morning session. 
	
	
 A German source said Germany had pledged 153 million marks (66.32 million dollars). 
	
	
 Japanese Ambassador to the EU Takayuki Kimura said his country had pledged 50 million dollars, in addition to technical assistance and another 10 million dollars to the whole of southeast Europe, most of it to Yugoslavia. 
	
	
 Johannes Linn, World Bank vice-president for Europe and Central Asia, said the bank had pledged 150 million dollars for the current calendar year and "over the next three years we expect to support Yugoslavia to the tune of about 540 million US dollars in concessional loans." 
	
	
 Linn said that as a result of recent changes in Belgrade, including the Milosevic extradition, "we will now be talking about Yugoslavia as an integral part of the successful formula of trust for economic recovery in the region." 
	
	
 Aside from the financial assistance, said Labus, "this conference is symbolic for us. We are now fully back into the international community, politically, diplomatically and financially, and that's very important for us. 
	
	
 "We decided to make some bold decisions," he said. "We decided to take the fast track to Europe and implement directly the international rules." 
	
	
 Labus said Milosevic's extradition "is of course a part of the equation," but added "broad economic reforms and democracy that we introduced into the country" had played a major role. 
	
	
 "The fact that Milosevic is on the way to be brought to justice is just a signal that my country is ready to respect all international obligations." 
	
	
 Labus recalled that his country was recovering from "a decade of dramatic economic decline, including trade isolation and sanctions... 
	
	
 "We are in the middle of a very complicated process of changing almost completely our political and economic system...This process is long and painful, but we are determined to win." 
	
	
 Infrastructure, including power, water, rail and roads, he said, were "suffering from many years of decay, mismanagement and the consequences of the NATO 1999 bombing campaign" that ended Belgrade's repression of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. 
	
	
 "A Yugoslavia that has a firm and decisive program of economic reforms in place is and is increasingly integrated into the wider international community is no longer a dream, it is now a reality." 
	
	
 "There is no quick fix" to the Yugoslav problem, the World Bank's Johannes Linn said. "But the costs of failing to support Yugoslavia as it struggles to break with the past would surely be higher still. 
	
	
 "The possibility of a democratic, stable and prosperous Yugoslavia moving toward integration with Europe is something which we dared not hope for only eight months ago." 
	
	
 In Berlin, Bodo Hombach, coordinator of the Balkans Stability Pact, said several delegations to the Brussels conference told him it was now "easier and more motivating" to supply Belgrade with the aid it desperately needs. 
	
	
 The Stability Pact was launched two years ago to rebuild the region after years of war and communism.	


	
Indonesian authorities have been alerted to the presence of another boat believed to be carrying illegal immigrants bound for Australia. Coastwatch Australia says the boat is 75 nautical miles from Christmas Island [Australian territory in the Indian Ocean], but is still in Indonesian waters. 
	
	
 Indonesia has notified merchant shipping in the area to check if the boat needs any assistance. There has been an unconfirmed report that a Norwegian ship has reached the vessel. 
	
	
 Earlier Australia's immigration minister, Philip Ruddock, said it was believed the boat was carrying 80 people. Coastwatch Australia has maintained surveillance flights in the area for the past two days and will continue flights tomorrow.	


	
Bangkok, Aug. 28 (CNA) -- The Taipei-based Chinese Federation of Labor (CFL) attended the Asian regional meeting of the International Labor Organization (ILO) held Tuesday in Bangkok, mainly because of its work to protect foreign laborers in Taiwan. 
	
	
 CFL President Lin Hui-kuan led the Taiwan delegation to the meeting in the name of observer of the International Confederation of Free Trade Union (ICFTU). It was the first time that a Taiwan labor group has been invited to participate in a meeting of the ILO, which is an affiliate of the United Nations. 
	
	
 The CFL's participation in the meeting did not meet with any objection from Beijing, as it attended as an observer of a non-U.N. organization. Beijing opposes Taiwan's participation in any international organization in which sovereignty is a prerequisite. 
	
	
 Lin told CNA that the CFL gained high appraisal in its efforts to protect the rights of Thai, Filipino, Indonesian and Vietnamese workers in Taiwan. 
	
	
 Taiwan is the only country in Asia that allows foreign laborers to enjoy the same salary levels as their local counterparts, which elevates its image in international society, Lin added. 
	
	
 He indicated that although Taiwan is not a U.N. member, it has signed two international agreements related to labor affairs and abides by all the regulations stipulated by the ILO. 
	
	
 Recently, Lin added, the Republic of China government was about to eliminate the minimum wage requirement for foreign workers mainly due to pressure from the business sector. However, through the protests of local labor groups, foreign laborers' working rights were protected, bringing extra attention to the power of Taiwan labor groups. 
	
	
 Lin noted that Taiwan is one of the ICFTU founders and that its participation in the ILO can serve as a model for Taiwan to take part in international activities. 
	
	
 Lin and his delegation are scheduled to return home Sept. 1 after the quadrennial meeting.	


	
A cow grazing near the village of Meresti [Harghita County] was bitten by a fox suffering from rabies. As a consequence, the cow was infected as well. This is the first such case here, and the third one since 1999. The symptoms appeared within a few days. The owner though that the animal was suffering from some intoxication, which was confirmed also by the veterinarian called to examine the cow. Very soon, however, the symptoms indicated that it was suffering from rabies: it was banging its head against the crib and it was very restless. The owner put down the animal, although the vet had forbidden him to do so. The latter took the cow's head to a lab, where they found that it had been suffering from rabies. The owner and a neighbor who had helped him put down the animal were sent urgently to the Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Miercurea Ciuc, where they received preventive anti-rabies treatment. The carcass of the cow was burned and buried, and the stable was disinfected.!
 The Harghita County Sanitary and Veterinary Directorate has started an anti-rabies campaign, in which they are to vaccinate more than 70,000 cattle, horses, sheep, and pigs in 22 localities.	


	
Russia favours creation of "international instruments" to regulate emissions 
	
	
 Text of report in English by Russian news agency Interfax 
	
	
 Moscow, 16 July: The Russian Foreign Ministry has called for "taking into account Russia's specific interests" in working out international documents concerning the regulation of emissions. A Foreign Ministry statement in connection with the opening of a conference of the signatories to the UN framework convention on climate change in Bonn reads that taking into account Russia's interests "is of vital importance from the viewpoint of prospects for the ratification of the Kyoto protocol inside the state". Russia is "interested in creating international instruments for regulating emissions, which will guarantee the stable economic development of all signatories to international agreements on the climate sphere without any exceptions", the statement reads. "The US decision to withdraw from introducing state measures to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases negatively affects the world community's efforts to ensure the global and efficient character of the Kyoto protocol," the document reads. 
	
	
	


	
China's minister in charge of Taiwan affairs says Beijing will not resort to force to defend Taiwan despite the changing situation on the island, which he described as "our renegade province". 
	
	
 Wang Yi, who made a three-day working visit to Thailand last week, sought to allay fears amongst allies in Asia about its cross-straits ties with Taiwan. He gave an assurance that the situation would not escalate into war despite the latter's acquisition of offensive weapons from the United States. 
	
	
 "Weapons cannot prevent Taiwan from reuniting with China," he told Thai and Chinese media last week. 
	
	
 Wang's visit, which will also take in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, comes as pressure mounts on both sides to resume dialogue as Beijing is poised to become a member of the World Trade Organisation next year. 
	
	
 Taiwan will follow suit shortly after. 
	
	
 He said Beijing will maintain its pursuit of peaceful unification with Taiwan and welcomed the resumption of dialogue, bogged down since 1999. 
	
	
 At that time, then president Lee Teng-hui demanded political parity by unilaterally redefining bilateral ties as "special state-to-state" relations. 
	
	
 While President Chen Shui-bian has mellowed his stance on independence, he has refused to bow to the "one-China policy", a precondition for dialogue. 
	
	
 In his latest speech, Chen said the long-standing dispute with China must be resolved through dialogue with respect to the principles of democracy and freedom. 
	
	
 Nevertheless, Taiwan heightened its diplomatic campaign through what Wang said was "parliamentarian" or "private diplomacy" to win recognition from Beijing's allies. 
	
	
 Beijing was so worried about the tactic that Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji raised the matter in May with Thai leaders during his official visit to Thailand. He said the number of Thai politicians visiting Taiwan, especially members of Parliament, was increasing at an "unusual" rate. 
	
	
 "We disapproved of these visits because no matter in what capacity these people travel, Taiwan treats them as official visits. To us, parliamentarians still hold a quasi-official status," he said. 
	
	
 Taiwanese officials in Bangkok always claimed these trips from Thailand to Taiwan were voluntary and initiated by the visitors themselves. 
	
	
 Wang said Beijing raised no objections to the so-called stop-over tactic used by Taiwanese leaders as long as the visits do not generate political activities in the host country. 
	
	
 Despite a still-tense relationship, Wang is optimistic reunification will eventually happen as was the case with Hong Kong and Macau. He said the decline in President Chen's popularity could be attributed to the drop in the number of people favouring independence. 
	
	
 "I believe less than 10 per cent of Taiwanese now favour independence," he said. 
	
	
 However, according to broad statistics, Taiwan-born voters favouring independence account for 65 per cent of the island's 23 million population. Wang believes unification will benefit people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Last year there were 2.85 million Taiwanese visitors in China, he said. 
	
	
	


	
On the afternoon of August 29, after several delays due to various causes, Japan successfully launched its H2A rocket No. 1 into space from Tanegashima Space Center. This milestone puts Japan's aerospace development program back on track. 
	
	
 The carrier rocket is the foundation of space exploration and utilization. It is also the first hurdle to overcome to realize any astronautical program. Japan previously developed the L and M series of launch vehicles. However, these two rockets are primarily used to launch low orbit satellites. In order to launch large stationary satellites, Japan developed the H series rocket. The major performance characteristics of the H series rocket are comparable to those developed by the United States and some European nations. The Japanese aerospace community takes a great deal of pride in this achievement. 
	
	
 In order to compete with the United States, Europe, and China, Japan decided to drastically reduce its costs, especially in every aspect of rocket design and manufacture. It adopted the simplest design and implemented various cost-cutting measures in an attempt to lower the manufacturing cost per satellite from 19 billion yen to 9 billion yen. It is supposed to be the next generation rocket that is both inexpensive and highly reliable. However, things did not go according to plan. This low cost approach brought about a series of satellite launch failures. In November 1999, a "multi-purpose" satellite was launched by H2 rocket No. 8. It did not enter its predetermined orbit and had to be destroyed. This was the third failure in a row. After this incident, Japan began to redesign the main engine of the H2 rocket. Eventually, the H2A rocket was developed. 
	
	
 In addition to carrier rockets, Japan also invested heavily in the development and utilization of various satellite technologies. Japan wishes to build a $21 billion per year aerospace industry centered on commercial satellite development. In the field of satellite communications, Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA) spent $310 million to develop the ETS-8 (Engineering Test Satellite 8) satellite. This satellite doubled the capacity of the test satellite previously launched by Japan. This program not only puts Japan in the lead in providing new mobile communication services in the Asia-Pacific region, but also allows Japan to test some new satellite communication techniques to be introduced worldwide. A Japanese made H2A rocket will launch this satellite in 2002. 
	
	
 Military surveillance satellites are also included in its development plan. Japan has prepared a military space program and allocated $1.3 billion to implement it. It will create a military surveillance satellite system consisting of two optical satellites and two radar satellites. 
	
	
 Japan also has a huge space power plant plan. It proposes to construct a gigantic solar power plant in space. The power generated will then converted to microwaves to be received by microwave receiver stations on earth. It is then converted back to electricity. In addition, it also plans to develop 12 satellites, a new generation of unmanned space lab, a space station supply system, and a space shuttle in the next 5 years. 
	
	
 In the past decade, despite its stagnating economy, Japan has still put space exploration as a top priority item in its space program. The Japanese aerospace industry has an ambitious plan to explore the planets. Its first target is the moon. Presently, Japan is implementing these plans in different stages. "Lunar A," one of the major projects, is aimed at delivering two penetrators on the moon to collect various data. One will be located near the landing site of Apollo 14 and the other near a ring-shaped mountain range on the dark side of the moon. "Selene," a project that has a $200 million price tag, will be launched in 2003. It is comprised of two lunar orbiters and a soft landing spacecraft. The soft-landing vehicle will be responsible for data collection and transmission back to earth for further processing. 
	
	
 Japan is determined to become a major power in aerospace. It is its national policy. It is also the path to becoming a major military power. Between 1970 and the end of 1999, Japan launched a total of 66 satellites. In terms of quantity, it is only behind the United States and Russia. In addition, it also takes part in the international space station project and has developed its own astronauts. Japan also has a relatively strong aerospace industry. In 1998, its revenue was 1.1 trillion yen, which represents a 10.5 percent market share worldwide. 
	
	
 After two years of stalemate, the Japanese government recently reorganized its aerospace development agency. Furthermore, it set priorities for the next five years. They include a spy satellite, a data relay satellite to transfer data between satellites, an unmanned universe lab system, a test satellite for communications and broadcasting, an observation satellite for environmental protection, "Kibo" the Japanese experimental module of the space station and its supply system, and the H2A carrier rocket to launch all the spacecraft mentioned earlier. By 2010, Japan will increase its global market share in aerospace to 17.4 percent. This is the goal set by the Japanese. 
	
	
	


	
JAMMU, India, Jan 12 (AFP) -- Four Pakistani soldiers were killed Saturday in cross-border shelling in Kashmir, Indian officials said. 
	
	
 Lieutenant Colonel H.S. Oberoi said Pakistani troops had started shelling Indian border villages in the Krishna Ghati area of Poonch, 255 kilometres (158 miles) northwest of Jammu, Kashmir's winter capital. 
	
	
 Indian forces retaliated, killing four Pakistani soldiers and destroying six bunkers, he said. 
	
	
 He said there were no Indian casualties, although some homes, which had been deserted by villagers, were damaged. 
	
	
	



   US begins flying Afghan prisoners to Cuba

 



  WASHINGTON: The US military on Thursday began flying al-Qaeda 
and Taliban prisoners under heavy guard from Afghanistan to jail 
at the American Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a military 
spokesman said.

  An Air Force C-17 cargo plane with 20 of at least 371 
"detainees" being held in Afghanistan departed Kandahar air base 
at about 11 am EST (1600 GMT), Marine Corps Maj. Brad Lowell, a 
spokesman for the US Central Command in Tampa, Florida, said.

  "There were 20" on the plane, Lowell said. He declined to say 
when the first prisoners might arrive at facilities surrounded 
by razor wire at the US Navy Base at Guantanamo Bay.

  US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told reporters that major 
security precautions were being taken in moving the prisoners, 
including hard-line, anti-Western followers of fugitive 
guerrilla leader Osama Bin Laden.

  Lowell said some small-arms fire was directed at US troops on 
the Kandahar base after the aircraft took off in the early 
evening Afghanistan time, but that the C-17 was not fired upon. 
No injuries were reported as a result of the gunfire, which came 
from outside the base, he added.

  "The aircraft had departed earlier when the Marines at the 
operating base received fire. At no time was that aircraft in 
any danger. It did not perform any evasive maneuvers," Lowell 
said.

  Marines dealing with Kandahar threat: "The Marines there are in 
the process of dealing with that threat. Our initial reports 
have no injuries."

  A US Marine spokesman in Kandahar told CNN late on Thursday that 
the gunfire came from snipers that penetrated the outer 
perimeter of the base and was not believed to be linked to the 
transfer of prisoners.

  "These were two isolated incidents, in that the detainee 
movement was something that we did not get official notification 
that we were going to do until this morning," Lt. James Jarvis 
said. "I don't believe that it is going to affect our transfer 
of detainees because, quite simply, we have adequate security 
for that."

  In Washington, US defense officials earlier said that 
unprecedented security -- including chains and possibly sedation 
and hoods -- might be used in transporting the prisoners, who 
include members of Bin Laden's al-Qaeda guerrilla network.

  One of the officials, who asked not to be identified, said that 
planning called for the prisoners, not yet charged with crimes, 
to be manacled together and outnumbered by specially trained 
guards carrying incapacitating stun guns.

  Others confirmed a report in USA Today that consideration was 
being given to tranquilizing some of the detainees and perhaps 
even covering their heads with hoods for flights that would take 
more than 12 hours.

  The human rights advocacy group Amnesty International expressed 
concern about reports that the prisoners "may be drugged, hooded 
and shackled," saying that they must be treated with full 
respect for international standards.

  "If restraints are necessary, they must be applied humanely, 
with adequate opportunity for the prisoner to move limbs, use 
the bathroom and eat and drink," the group said in a statement.

  Rumsfeld told reporters on Thursday that every effort would be 
made to secure hardline prisoners, many considered dangerous and 
possibly suicidal followers of Bin Laden. The al-Qaeda leaders 
is accused by Washington of masterminding the September 11 
suicide aircraft attacks on New York and Washington.

  "They (military officials) have been authorized and instructed 
to use appropriate restraints. They are fully aware that these 
are dangerous individuals," he said during a press conference 
with Australian Defence Minister Robert Hill.

  'Willing to kill themselves, others': "There are among these 
prisoners people who are perfectly willing to kill themselves 
and kill other people," Rumsfeld added. He provided no details 
except to say that the Pentagon had consulted experts on prisons 
and prisoners.

  The US military has so far taken control of more than 300 
prisoners at a base in Kandahar and others at Bagram air base 
near Kabul, at Mazar-i-Sharif and aboard the Navy helicopter 
assault ship USS Bataan in the northern Indian Ocean.

  The Pentagon refused to discuss details of the transfer, and 
Defence Department spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said on Thursday 
that no announcements would be made until the first detainees 
arrived at the secluded base, where a high-security, barbed 
wire-enclosed facility is being built.

  "What we have done all along is (said) that they are being 
treated humanely in accordance with the Geneva Convention," 
Clarke told reporters.

  The convention sets out the rights and responsibilities of war 
prisoners and their guards.

  Hundreds of US military police and Marine Corps reinforcements 
have been flown to the "Gitmo" base, as it is called, in Cuba 
and prisoners will be held inside a compound ringed by two 
fences topped with razor wire.

  For most of the day they will be held in small cells with a 
concrete floor and chain-link walls, with spotlights on at 
night.

  It was not known if American John Walker, captured fighting with 
Bin Laden's now vanquished protectors the Taliban, would be 
among those brought to Guantanamo.

  The Defence Department has not announced any decision on how 
many of the detainees will be transferred or how many, if any, 
might face military courts martial authorized by President 
George W Bush in the wake of the September attacks.

  Under close scrutiny from civil rights groups, Rumsfeld has been 
studying how such trials could be held while protecting the 
rights of any defendants and keeping tight security over the US 
war on terrorism declared by Bush after the attacks.

   Mugabe confident of victory in historic Zimbabwe vote

 



  HARARE-Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe predicted victory 
Saturday as he cast his ballots in presidential and local 
elections at a primary school in Harare's working-class suburb 
of Highfield.

  Asked if he would accept the results of the hotly contested 
election, Mugabe said: "I will accept it, more than accept it 
because I will have won."

  The 78-year-old former guerrilla leader, who has governed since 
independence in 1980, took another swipe at the former colonial 
power Britain and other western nations, which he said have 
prejudged the vote.

  "They don't want the president of Zimbabwe to remain the 
president of Zimbabwe," he told reporters outside the school.

  Mugabe has faced widespread criticism and sanctions from the 
European Union and the United States over alleged rights 
violations and manipulation of the election process.

  Tinkering has left voting procedures so confusing in Harare that 
even Mugabe and his top aides appeared unsure of where the 
president was to vote.

  Mugabe was clearly expected to turn up at Mhofu School in 
Highfield, where state television had a truck posted and had 
been broadcasting live since polls opened early Saturday.

  Several of Mugabe's ministers and senior aides were also on hand 
to see their leader cast his ballot, as well as a throng of 
reporters and camera operators.

  But it turned out the president would perform his civic duty 
instead at Kudzanai School, also in Highfield. Mugabe had to 
vote at that particular ward in order to be able to cast ballots 
both for president and for mayor in Harare, which is holding the 
two elections simultaneously.

  The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) complained 
that the set-up was deliberately confusing in a ploy to 
discourage the urban vote, which is thought to favor Mugabe's 
challenger Morgan Tsvangirai. -AFP

China criticizes US human rights report

 



  BEIJING - China issued its annual report on human rights in the 
United States on Monday, accusing Washington of turning a blind 
eye to abuses in its own land while criticizing other countries 
for theirs.

  The report by the Information Office of the State Council, 
China's Cabinet, listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, 
racial discrimination and lack of personal safety in the United 
States, the official Xinhua news agency said.

  It also accused Washington of "wantonly infringing" on the 
sovereignty of other nations through military operations and 
stationing US forces overseas, Xinhua said.

  The report also slammed US President George W. Bush's 
administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on 
cutting greenhouse gases.

  China releases the report every year in response to a US State 
Department report on global human rights conditions, which 
usually accuses China of widespread abuses. The US report came 
out last week.

  "Once again the United States, assuming the role of `world judge 
of human rights' has distorted human rights conditions in many 
countries and regions in the world, including China, and accused 
them of human rights violations, all the while turning a blind 
eye to its own human rights-related problems," the Chinese 
report said.

   Mugabe victory leaves West in tatters

 



  HARARE: Western countries were left frustrated and impotent 
after Robert Mugabe formally declared that he had overwhelmingly 
won Zimbabwe's presidential election.

  The extent to which Mugabe outmanoeuvred the west was made clear 
when southern African countries issued a surprise statement 
declaring the conduct of the election free and fair. The move is 
almost certain to scupper any hope of the Commonwealth 
suspending Zimbabwe next week.

  At the weekend the European Union, prodded by Britain, is 
planning to extend the range of sanctions against Zimbabwe, 
targeting more members of the leadership. Earlier this year, the 
EU imposed a travel ban on Mugabe and 19 members of his regime 
and froze their overseas assets. But there were no illusions in 
Britain or elsewhere in Europe that the measures will have any 
real leverage in Harare.

  The Zimbabwe registrar-general, Tobaiwa Mudede, declared that 
Mugabe had won a fifth term in office after the results from all 
120 constituencies were returned. He said Mugabe had won 
1,685,212 votes against 1,258,401 for challenger Morgan 
Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).

  "We foresaw electoral fraud but not daylight robbery," 
Tsvangirai said. "We find ourselves unable to endorse the 
purported election of President Robert Mugabe as Zimbabwe's 
president in this election. It's the biggest election fraud I've 
witnessed in my life."

  The MDC leader said the onus was on "the people" to lead the 
way, whether passively or not. "We seek no confrontation with 
the state because that's what they want. But the people 
themselves have to decide what action to take," he said.

  In the Harare townships where people stood in line for two days 
to vote in the belief that they were consigning Mugabe to 
history, angry residents looked to Tsvangirai to confront the 
government.

  "We need Tsvangirai to tell Mugabe he cannot steal this 
election," said Noel Gukuta, a youthful MDC voter. "The soldiers 
have guns so we cannot fight him but we can make sure he cannot 
rule us. We must strike, we must march, we must show that we are 
not goats." The country took the news of Mugabe's victory with 
no great celebrations or protests.

  The government, sensing murmurs about revolt, put the army on 
full alert, deployed troops in key townships and the police set 
up roadblocks on the main roads into Harare to stop and search 
vehicles for weapons.

  The UK foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said: "For months the 
government of Zimbabwe has conducted a systematic campaign of 
violence and intimidation, designed to achieve an outcome - 
power at all costs."

  A senior state department official in Washington later said: 
"We're considering further steps, given all the things that 
happened before and during the elections." Apart from the 
result, the main jolt yesterday was that election observers from 
South Africa, Nigeria and Namibia effectively endorsed the 
election.

  "It is our considered view that the election was free and fair 
and reflects the wishes of the people of Zimbabwe," Namibia's 
observer team said in a statement, adding that the poll was 
"watertight, without room for rigging".

  The South African team described the election as "legitimate" 
while the Nigerian observers said they had seen nothing that 
threatened the integrity of the poll.

  The Commonwealth trio to decide on action next week is made up 
of Australia, which will back suspension, the South African 
leader, Thabo Mbeki, and the Nigerian president, Olusegun 
Obasanjo. In Zimbabwe the leadership of the congress of trade 
unions is considering calling a two-day general strike to test 
whether there would be popular support for a longer protest, and 
various civil rights groups are meeting today to discuss mass 
civil disobedience. The MDC's lawyers are also studying the 
possibility of legal action.

  In the final results, Mugabe made a net gain of votes compared 
with the 2000 parliamentary election in every province in the 
country. While there was evidence of vote tampering in some 
areas, most of the ballots dropped into the box with a cross by 
Mugabe's name were not fraudulent. There has been no criticism 
of the count.

  "This is a runaway victory," said the justice minister, Patrick 
Chinamasa. "It was won on the issue of the land."-Dawn/The 
Guardian News Service.

   US human rights report termed inaccurate

 



  ISLAMABAD, March 5: The government on Tuesday rejected the US 
State Department Report on human rights as "factually inaccurate 
and unwarranted" adding that it reflected tendency of some 
states to sit in judgment on others.

  "The reports fails to acknowledge the important policy measures 
and initiatives by the government of Pakistan to promote and 
protect human rights," said a statement issued by Foreign Office 
spokesman in which the report was termed as factually inaccurate 
and unwarranted. It pointed out that all the goals set at an 
April 2000 human rights conference had been achieved, which it 
added had been ignored by the report.

  Enlisting these initiatives, it recalled that these include 
promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the 
establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, 
police and jail reforms, national policy and plan of action for 
elimination of child labour and establishment of a fund for 
rehabilitation of working children.

  The government, it added, has amended Pakistan Citizenship Act 
of 1951 to enable women of Pakistani descent to claim Pakistani 
nationality for their children born to foreign husbands. A mass 
awareness campaign was launched as part of the observance of the 
Year 2000 as the year of Human Rights and Human Dignity, it 
added.

  In addition, it said, Pakistan also ratified ILO Conventions 100 
on equal remuneration and 182 on the elimination of worst forms 
of child labour. It signed the Optional Protocols to Convention 
on the Rights of Child. Recently the system of joint electorates 
has been introduced respecting the wishes of the minority 
communities, it said. Despite these developments, the report 
states "the government's human rights record remained poor."

  "This is unacceptable and a gross misstatement of the facts. The 
government of Pakistan therefore, feels constrained to reject 
the assessment of the report about Pakistan, and the tendency of 
some states to sit in judgment over others."

  "The cause of human rights would be better served if all states, 
in a spirit of cooperation and understanding address the 
problems they face in promoting and protecting human rights," it 
said.

Pakistan rejects US human rights report

 



  ISLAMABAD - Pakistan Tuesday slated US State Department's 
country report on human rights situation in Pakistan and 
labelled it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted."

  "The report fails to acknowledge the important policy measures 
and initiatives by the Government of Pakistan to promote and 
protect human rights," a Foreign Office spokesman said.

  The spokesman said that the US report ignored the implementation 
of almost all initiatives announced and set at an April 2000 
human rights conference.

  These initiatives included the promulgation of the Juvenile 
Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a Permanent 
Commission on the Status of Women, police and jail reforms, 
national policy and Plan of Action for elimination of child 
labour and establishment of a fund for rehabilitation of working 
children.

  The spokesman said: "The Government has amended Pakistan 
Citizenship Act of 1951 to enable women of Pakistani descent to 
claim Pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign 
husbands. A mass awareness campaign was launched as part of the 
observance of the Year 2000 as the Year of Human Rights and

  The spokesman said that despite these developments, the report 
states `the Govt's human rights record remained poor'. "This is

said.

  "The Government of Pakistan, therefore, feels constrained to

tendency of some states to sit in judgement over others. The 
cause of human rights would be better served if all states, in a 
spirit of cooperation and understanding, address the problems 
they face in promoting and protecting human rights."

  He said that the Government of Pakistan remains committed to 
promoting and protecting human rights and will welcome the 
assistance of friendly countries towards that end.




Britain's Prescott Pushes for Kyoto Pact Backing

 



  VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- The Kyoto Protocol on reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions must be ratified even without U.S. 
support, British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott told an 
international conference on business and the environment on 
Friday.

  Prescott said that while the U.S. decision to reject the Kyoto 
agreement is a cause for concern, pressure will be maintained on 
the Bush administration to go further with its current voluntary 
emission-reduction targets.

  "This is the world's best chance of dealing with a very serious 
threat to it," Prescott told delegates from 65 nations at the 
Globe 2002 conference in Vancouver that ended on Friday.

  Prescott, Britain's front man in pushing the accord, said the 
United States until recently was critical of the science that 
led to the Kyoto pact but has now accepted it, and he remains 
optimistic that the goals of the United States and of other 
signatory nations would converge.

  The Kyoto Protocol calls on countries to reduce emissions of 
so-called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which are 
blamed by many scientists for global warming, to pre-1990 levels 
by 2012.

  Named for the Japanese city where it was approved, the pact was 
signed by 84 countries, including the United States and Canada. 
Fifty-five countries responsible for 55 percent of emissions in 
1990 must ratify it for it to take effect. Forty-nine countries 
had done so as of mid-March, according to the United Nations.

  Europe's environment ministers have agreed that all 15 EU 
nations should adhere to the Kyoto Protocol. Ratification could 
win support at an EU summit later this month in Barcelona, 
Spain. The process is expected to be completed by June 1.

  Prescott said the British program aims to cut emissions by 20 
percent, and the country is now half way to that goal.

  The issue has pitted business groups, who claim the accord will 
hurt the global economy, against environmentalists, who warn of 
the dire effects from global warming such as higher ocean levels 
and destruction of various plants and animal species.

  Canada is among the countries that have pledged to ratify the 
accord. Canada's Environmental Minister, David Anderson, is 
under pressure from the country's energy producers to follow the 
U.S. position.

  Prescott came to Anderson's support on Friday, agreeing that 
financial figures quoted by Kyoto opponents in Canada about the 
potential damage to the Canadian economy were "pure fiction."

  A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters Association 
said the accord would cost the Canadian economy up to C$40 
billion by 2010, but a Dutch report released earlier this week 
said it would only be C$727 million.

  "At the least the difference between some estimates clearly 
shows a great deal more talking and assessment is needed," 
Reuters quoted Prescott as telling the delegates, who 
represented both business and environmental groups.


Elaborating on the 'axis of evil'

 



  PRESIDENT GEORGE Bush's National Security Adviser Condoleezza 
Rice has recently "defined" the context and scope of the term 
"axis of evil" that Bush used in his State of the Union address 
a few weeks ago to describe Iraq, Iran and North Korea. The 
criteria set by Rice are the following: the three countries in 
question are repressive and grave human rights violators, and 
aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction.

  By all conservative estimates, there are scores of other 
countries which can easily qualify as repressive and violating 
human rights. The rule, as far as human rights are concerned, is 
that every nation which does not enjoy pluralistic democracy is 
violating human rights and is therefore oppressive. There are 
many countries in the world that hardly qualify as pluralistic 
democracies. On this count, the national security adviser may 
have erred.

  As for her wording regarding acquisition of weapons, what is 
particularly noteworthy is the use of the words "aggressively 
seeking" nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. In other 
words, countries which are seeking or developing such arsenal at 
a slow pace do not seem to come within the scope of the "axis of 
evil". One can name more than a dozen countries which are 
contemplating the acquisition of mass destruction weapons at one 
speed or another. All other countries which are seemingly 
refraining from acquiring such weapons are doing so not so much 
to escape being branded as "evil" but rather because they have 
neither the knowledge nor the money to join the "nuclear club".

  Come to think of it, acquiring weapons of mass destruction per 
se may not be a correct basis for judging whether a nation is 
good or evil. The mere development or possession of mass 
destruction weapons is not in itself a reason to label a state 
as evildoer. After all, the US is the first nation to have 
developed nuclear weapons. Moreover, the US is the first and 
only nation ever to deploy such weapons.

  Perhaps the real criterion in this context is whether the 
nuclear country is democratic in every sense of the word.

  Washington seems to be particularly disturbed and feel that its 
own national security is being threatened only when the nations 
which acquire mass destruction weapons are authoritarian or 
repressive, irrespective of the pace of amassing weaponry. This 
is, in fact, the fear of all countries, as they feel that 
democratic regimes are more restrained and responsible when it 
comes to resorting to weapons of mass destruction. If this is 
the case, Rice could have elaborated more precise criteria for 
membership in the "axis of evil," by establishing more clearly 
the connection between the nature of the regime and the 
acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.

Stretching The Case For Inhumanity

  
Terrorist thugs at Gitmo don't deserve their treatment

  
By Vito Fossella

  Having had the opportunity to tour Camp X-Ray last week, I offer 
America's critics a simple piece of advice: Get a life.

  The chronic complainers are outraged by, of all things, the 
treatment of the captured Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists being 
detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. They have absurdly criticized 
as "inhumane" the decision to temporarily place prison suits, 
handcuffs and blindfolds on the terrorists during transfer to 
protect the military personnel guarding them. They have even 
demanded upgraded accommodations, seemingly forgetting that 
these are the leaders of a worldwide terrorist organization who 
have repeatedly vowed to kill innocent Americans through war or 
terror.

  Far from being treated inhumanely, the al Qaeda and the Taliban 
terrorists are better fed, better clothed and better cared for 
than they would be if they were still roaming the cold caves of 
Afghanistan. They eat three nutritious meals a day, including 
halal, cereal and granola bars. They enjoy their own large cell, 
talking freely with one another, worshiping with a prayer 
leader, and writing home.

  Indeed, the evil-doers at Camp X-Ray are getting far better 
treatment than they deserve - hot showers, a warm Caribbean 
climate and access to the exact same medical care as the 
military personnel who live on the base. It seems our critics 
would prefer that the Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists instead 
stay at the Ritz-Carlton.

  By way of contrast, the men and women of our military who have 
the extremely dangerous job of guarding these thugs live in 
12-person tents, take cold showers using a hose, and often must 
cope without the benefits of electricity. They have been away 
from home for months, and they serve our nation with dignity and 
honor.

  As I toured Camp X-Ray, I stared into the faces of evil. As I 
stood just feet away from barbarians who only weeks earlier 
fired machine guns at American troops, incited bloody prison 
riots and ambushes and, boasted of plans to kill innocent 
people, I could not help but feel the grief and anguish of those 
who lost loved ones on September 11 or during the war in 
Afghanistan. I have no doubt that, if given the opportunity, any 
of the detainees would have relished the chance to kill me. 
Indeed, since their arrival at Camp-X-Ray, some of the 
terrorists have openly threatened the Marines who guard them and 
talk anxiously about returning home soon to continue terrorizing 
the American people.

  There is a greater purpose behind Camp X-Ray than merely 
detaining these violent enemies of the United States. At 
Guantanamo Bay, federal officials are conducting extensive 
interviews with the Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists, culling 
information on the terrorist network and the whereabouts and 
future plans of the tens of thousands of terrorists who were 
trained in the same camps and who are now living around the 
world.

  Already, intelligence gathered from other al Qaeda detainees has 
uncovered potential plots to attack American embassies, nuclear 
power plants and public water facilities. In the caves and 
hideouts of al Qaeda operatives, we have found instruction books 
on how to build chemical and biological weapons, detailed maps 
of American cities and descriptions of landmarks. The type of 
work that is occurring at Camp X-Ray may prove critical to 
preventing a new attack.

  President Bush and America deserve appreciation from all corners 
of the globe for leading the world in the war against terrorism 
and for making every nation safer.

  America's treatment of the Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists at 
Camp X-Ray is appropriate and, in my opinion, too good for these 
murderous thugs. Instead of lecturing the United States, our 
critics may better spend their time reminding others that if 
terrorists don't want to be detained at Camp X-Ray, they should 
join the civilized world.

   Officials bristle at US human rights report

 



  
Response is being prepared

  
Khalil Fleihan

  
Daily Star correspondent

  Local authorities have expressed dissatisfaction - but not 
surprise - with regard to excerpts about Lebanon in the US State 
Department's annual report on human rights, a copy of which has 
been delivered to the Foreign Ministry.

  An official source who described the reaction on Tuesday said 
the criticism was an annual event and emphasized that it was not 
directed at human rights in Lebanon only, but covered several 
other countries in as well.

  A copy of the report, which criticizes what it described as the 
weakening of the central government's prerogatives, has been 
handed over by the deputy chief of mission at the US Embassy in 
Awkar, Carol Kalin, to the Foreign Ministry's acting 
director-general, Naji Abi Assi.

  The source said that the ministry would soon deliver copies of 
the report to the various ministries concerned, especially the 
Interior and Municipalities Ministry, prior to relaying its 
observations to the State Department in Washington.

  The report was seen as discrediting Lebanon by portraying the 
country as being undemocratic or uncivilized and abusing human 
rights, the source added. According to the source, the 
authorities' dissatisfaction with the contents of the report has 
been conveyed to US Ambassador Vincent Battle, who returned from 
Washington on Saturday after participating in a conference of 
American envoys posted to Arab countries.

  Each year, Lebanon sends an explanation to the State Department 
about the factors outside of the government's control.

  The source said the most serious point in the report was an 
observation that the judiciary was subjected to political 
pressure, but referring to it as being "independent in 
principle."

  The report's reference to intelligence agents' monitoring the 
activities of opposition politicians and tapping the phones of 
certain government leaders "is a serious matter and harms 
Lebanon's image as a democratic country," the source added.

  On the other hand, the report praised the role played by the 
Lebanese press, describing it as containing daily criticism of 
the government and its practices.

  When is a war prisoner not a POW? When the U.S. brings Afghan 
detainees to Guantanamo Bay

  
By Michael Elliott

  It's not going to be a country club," said Defense Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld last week, describing the new military detention 
camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and nobody ever expected it would 
be. The 110 al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners admitted to "Gitmo" 
by the end of last week are, said Rumsfeld, "the hardest of the 
hard core," men who had killed "dozens and dozens of people." 
But though it may lack tennis courts and a putting green, the 
amenities are better than you'd find in a cave at Tora Bora. 
True, prisoners are now confined to 6-ft. by 8-ft. chain-link 
enclosures with concrete floors and tin roofs (Rumsfeld thinks 
it's "pejorative" to call them cages). But relief will come; in 
three months, the Pentagon hopes to replace the facility with 
something more permanent.

  In the meantime, the prisoners at Camp X-Ray--as the place has 
been called since the early 1990s when it housed Haitian 
refugees--have been given thin green mats and blankets on which 
to sleep and pray, and are allowed to shower and exercise. They 
are provided with a medical exam upon admission, and their diet 
(is someone making a point about diversity here?) ranges from 
bagels and cream cheese to rice and beans--all eaten with 
plastic utensils--after which the prisoners may clean their 
teeth with specially shortened brushes. (The caution makes 
sense; in 2000 Mamdouh Salim, an al-Qaeda operative awaiting 
trial in New York City for his part in the 1998 embassy 
bombings, used a comb to stab a prison guard through the eye.)

  So far, humanitarian groups have been muted in their criticism 
of the conditions at Guantanamo. Last week a delegation from the 
International Committee of the Red Cross arrived to inspect the 
camp and offer private recommendations on its operation. But in 
the European press, the prisoners' lot has become a public issue 
of contention among those who demand that U.S. conduct be above 
suspicion. Three detainees are said to have claimed to be 
British citizens. Politicians and commentators in London are now 
clamoring that all held in Gitmo must be guaranteed treatment in 
accordance with international law. The Daily Telegraph, a paper 
usually so conservative that it makes Pat Buchanan look 
vegetarian, warned Washington of the need to draw a "distinction 
between civilized society and the apocalyptic savagery of those 
who would destroy it."

  At the heart of the matter is a question of legality. The 
Pentagon has resisted calling the detainees prisoners of war, 
preferring the terms unlawful combatants or battlefield 
detainees. It's easy to see why. Under the Geneva Convention, 
those holding true POWs are bound to release them at the end of 
hostilities; but that is the last thing the U.S. wants to do 
with men who may be al-Qaeda operatives. Moreover, by convention 
(though the law seems to be murky here) POWs don't need to tell 
their captors anything other than their name, rank, serial 
number and birthday. But for Washington, the whole point of the 
detention is to conduct interrogations and thus head off new 
acts of terrorism.

  The Geneva Convention does contemplate that some irregular 
forces captured in battle need not be considered POWs. That may 
well apply to members of al-Qaeda, a free-floating band of 
terrorists. But not all of those at Gitmo are al-Qaeda men. 
Some--the Pentagon won't say how many--were members of the 
Taliban and presumably thought they were part of the Afghan 
army. Are they POWs? Washington says no, because the Taliban had 
no clear chain of command and was not a legitimate government. 
That may be so; unfortunately, as Amnesty International has 
pointed out, under the Geneva Convention the Pentagon has no 
business making such a determination. Those who fall into the 
enemy's hands are entitled to POW status until a "competent 
tribunal" has determined their status. In the case of those in 
Cuba, that hasn't happened.

  More curious still is the matter of the prisoners' ultimate 
fate. Rumsfeld has laid out four options: a military trial, a 
trial in U.S. criminal courts, return to their home countries 
for prosecution, or continued detention "while additional 
intelligence is gathered." The last seems a distinct 
possibility; the Pentagon plans to build 2,000 cells at Camp 
X-Ray. "This will be a big deal down there for at least two 
years, guaranteed," says Army Lieut. General B.B. Bell, who 
commands Fort Hood, Texas, the base from which military police 
have been deployed to Cuba. But it's hard to find a 
justification for such detention in the Geneva Convention or 
anywhere else. Leaving the prisoners "indefinitely beyond the 
reach of any legal regime," said the Economist last week, "would 
put America--pre-eminently a nation of laws--itself outside the 
law."

  Until the Pentagon sorts out the legal issues, criticism from 
Europe is likely to grow. Still, things could be worse. The 
prisoners may be in Cuba, but nobody has yet forced them to 
listen to Fidel Castro's long-winded speeches. Now that really 
would be cruel.

U.S. Tells China Taiwan Remarks a Mistake - Xinhua

 



  BEIJING -- The United States told China U.S. President George W. 
Bush had made a mistake when he called Taiwan a country in a 
speech last week, the official Xinhua news agency reported on 
Sunday.

  Washington told China the U.S. government has not changed its 
Taiwan policy and said it would not refer to Taiwan in that way 
again, Xinhua quoted a foreign ministry spokeswoman as saying.

  Reports in Taiwanese newspapers on Friday said Bush called the 
island the "Republic of Taiwan" and a "country" in a speech to 
diplomats and business executives on Thursday.

  Calling Taiwan a country would threaten to compromise a major 
pillar of Sino-U.S. relations, which were set up in 1979 largely 
based on a U.S. nod to the "One China" Principle, which states 
that Taiwan is a part of China, Reuters reported.

  Beijing, which regards the island as a wayward province to be 
reunited with the mainland by force if necessary, asked for an 
explanation on Saturday of why Bush had referred to Taiwan as a 
country.

  Taiwan's ***United Daily News ***quoted a U.S. official as 
saying Bush's labeling Taiwan as a republic was a "slip of the 
tongue" and indicated no shift in U.S. policy.

  Bush was referring to the entry late last year and this year of 
China and Taiwan, respectively, into the World Trade 
Organization, reports said.

  The English-language ***Taipei Times ***newspaper quoted Bush as 
saying it was "important to recognize and to welcome both 
countries, both the Republic of Taiwan, and of course China, 
into the World Trade Organization."

  The Taiwan issue has often caused rough patches in bilateral 
ties and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have angered Beijing.

  Last month an editorial in the official ***China Daily *** 
newspaper said Beijing felt "betrayed" after a U.S. decision to 
allow Taiwanese Defense Minister Tang Yiau-Ming into the United 
States for talks with Defense officials and warned of a setback 
in Sino-U.S. ties.

  But foreign ministry officials later confirmed both sides were 
moving ahead with plans for a scheduled visit by Chinese 
Vice-President Hu Jintao to the United States in late April.


Bush Takes Great Leap Forward In Pledging U.S. Help In Defending Taiwan

  Bush Takes Great Leap Forward In Pledging U.S. Help In Defending 
Taiwan

  
By Richard Halloran

  In a closed-door meeting in Florida last week, the Bush 
administration took a great leap forward in its declared policy 
that Taiwan remain separate from China so long as the people of 
Taiwan wish, even if that requires U.S. military force.

  The host of the three-day U.S.-Taiwan Defense Summit was Frank 
Carlucci, chairman of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, onetime 
deputy director of central intelligence, national security 
adviser to President Reagan, later secretary of defense and 
possibly the most secretive official in Washington in many 
years.

  Why the meeting was so hidden was not clear, other than to avoid 
flaunting it in the face of China, which claims sovereignty over 
Taiwan and protests every American action favoring the island. 
Even so, enough leaked out to illuminate President Bush's 
policy, which has been consistent ever since he enunciated it 
during his campaign for the presidency.

  The centerpiece was a visit by Taiwan's defense minister, Tang 
Yao-ming, the first since President Carter switched U.S. 
diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979. That Tang 
was invited was more evidence that Bush has adopted the most 
pro-Taiwan posture of any president in nearly a quarter century; 
his stance differs distinctly from that of President Clinton, 
who tilted in favor of Beijing.

  The senior U.S. official at the gathering was Deputy Secretary 
of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, who has written: "It would be a 
strategic as well as a moral mistake for the United States to 
ever let China use force to have its way with Taiwan." He has 
cautioned, however, that the United States expected Taiwan to 
avoid provoking China.

  Tang asserted that Taiwan would do no such thing. After talking 
with Wolfowitz for two hours, Tang said he had guaranteed that 
his government would "by no means take any provocative step" 
toward China.

  The meeting, at an exclusive resort in St. Petersburg, brought 
out representatives of America's biggest defense contractors -- 
Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, General 
Dynamics, United Technologies, Textron, Honeywell International, 
and United Defense. Among them, they make every weapon Taiwan 
could possibly want to fend off the expanding might of China.

  China's military threat to Taiwan is not immediate. Adm. Dennis 
Blair, who commands U.S. forces in the Pacific, told Congress 
recently: "The PLA (Peoples Liberation Army) is still years away 
from the capability to take and hold Taiwan."

  The admiral cautioned, however: "Continued improvements in 
Taiwan's capabilities and development of USPACOM (United States 
Pacific Command) capabilities will be necessary to maintain 
sufficient defense."

  Bush began enunciating his policy on Taiwan in November 1999, 
saying that he would honor "our promises to the people of 
Taiwan" and "we deny the right of Beijing to impose their rule 
on a free people."

  The Republican election platform reflected the candidate's 
policy: "All issues regarding Taiwan's future must be resolved 
peacefully and must be agreeable to the people of Taiwan." It 
said that if China attacked Taiwan, "the United States will 
respond appropriately in accordance with the Taiwan Relations 
Act."

  The TRA, adopted after Carter broke relations with Taiwan, 
commits the United States to provide defensive arms to Taiwan 
and to view a threat from China with "grave concern." Bush has 
repeatedly referred to the TRA in a not-so-subtle message to 
China that the law is the bedrock of his posture on Taiwan.

  The most succinct statement of the Bush policy came from 
Secretary of State Colin Powell during his Senate confirmation 
hearing in January 2001: "We expect and demand a peaceful 
settlement, one acceptable to people on both sides of the Taiwan 
Strait."

  Shortly after Bush took office, he approved the largest U.S. 
arms sale to Taiwan, allowing Taiwan to buy four destroyers, 
eight diesel-powered submarines, 12 anti-submarine aircraft and 
a flock of missiles and other weapons.

  At the same time, he said the United States would do whatever it 
takes to help defend Taiwan. He told an interviewer: "China must 
know that if circumstances warrant, that we will uphold the 
spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act." Whatever decision Bush 
makes, a defense official said, the Pacific Command is ready "to 
respond to any potential crisis, including the use of force 
against Taiwan by China."

  The critical question: Will the Chinese, noting American 
military operations in Afghanistan, heed these warnings or will 
they miscalculate and try to call Bush's bluff?

Times in Asia and a former editorial director of the

Jordan to sign Kyoto Protocol

 



  AMMAN - Jordan said it will sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact 
on impeding global greenhouse gas emissions, following a recent 
Cabinet decision, according to Faris Juneidi, director general 
of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP).

  "Soon, the government will delegate Jordan's representative to 
the United Nations, HH Prince Zeid Ben Raad, to sign the 
protocol," Juneidi told The Jordan Times on Tuesday, adding that 
an exact date for signing of the environmental agreement had not 
been set.

  In 1997, at a UN conference in Kyoto, Japan, the Kyoto Protocol 
legally obliged developed countries to reduce the amount of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 8 per cent (below 1990 levels) 
between 2008 and 2012.

  Although developed countries are the world's main source of 
large-scale air pollution, Jordan's decision to sign the 
protocol is aimed at stressing its "commitment towards the 
different international conventions," Juneidi said.

  With the signing of the protocol, he said, GCEP hopes to attract 
more funding to contribute to the international community's 
efforts in reducing greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the 
earth's atmosphere thus causing climate change.

  GCEP, an agency operating under the Ministry of Municipal and 
Rural Affairs and the Environment, is the country's point of 
reference for environmental pacts.

  On Monday, the 15 European Union member states agreed to be 
formally bound to the Kyoto accord, and complete the 
ratification by June 1 this year.

  In March 2001, the US administration opposed the protocol by 
saying that it contravenes US economic interests, a decision 
slammed by European Union countries at the time. Instead the US 
government produced its own alternative climate change strategy 
aimed at encouraging industries to trim their emissions.

  Other developed countries like Canada have shown reluctance 
towards signing the Kyoto Protocol, saying it would cut the 
national GDP by up to 2.5 per cent in 2010 and cause economic 
damage worth 30 billion Canadian dollars ($19 billion).


72 Hours At Camp X-Ray

72 Hours At Camp X-Ray

  As the detention camp reaches capacity, reporters are invited to 
watch the interplay between detainees, guards and doctors.

  
By Paul De La Garza

  GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba - It begins as a shiny speck in 
the southeast skies of the lone landing strip here at Gitmo, the 
oldest U.S. base overseas. Within minutes the lumbering, gray 
C-141B Starlifter flies low over the tarmac and over a patch of 
palm trees, as if part of an annual air show. On a hot and windy 
afternoon, the deep blue waters of the Caribbean serve as the 
postcard backdrop.

  When the cargo jet finally lands, approaching the landing strip 
from the west, the noise is deafening.

  Almost immediately a crack security force of mostly baby-faced 
Marines surrounds the plane. They wear black baseball leg guards 
and bulletproof vests and carry M-16 rifles.

  Meanwhile, Humvees mounted with .50-caliber machine guns and 
40mm grenade launchers take their positions. A Navy helicopter 
whirls overhead.

  Once the aircraft is secured, the freak show begins, a sort of 
"Hannibal the Cannibal" production. Down the back ramp of the 
mammoth aircraft, the guards slowly unload the latest detainees 
from the war in Afghanistan, 34 altogether.

  Wearing bright orange wool knit caps, blacked-out goggles, 
earmuffs, white surgical masks, bright orange jumpsuits, denim 
jackets, beige mittens (taped around the wrists), handcuffs and 
ankle shackles, the detainees don't look natural.

  
They look like giant bright orange flies.

  After a 25-hour flight of mostly sitting, the prisoners hobble 
along as the Marines, who look twice as big, walk them out and 
frisk them. One soldier handles a captive like a mannequin - 
moving him back, forward, and to the side - before lifting him 
straight off his feet and onto one of two waiting buses.

  
"Walk! Walk!" the guards shout.

  
"Shut up! Head down!"

  "Man, they must be so scared," says a TV camerawoman watching 
with an international media pool from about 400 yards away.

  
"It must be freaky," chimes in her colleague.

  The prisoners are here because the military considers them 
"hard-core" terrorists - willing to escape, to kill themselves 
and others. But now they do pretty much as directed. They walk, 
they shut up, they lower their heads. They board buses that will 
take them to a ferry that will take them across Guantanamo Bay 
to a detention facility known as Camp X-Ray.

  A sign near the ferry slip conveys some of the strange vibe of 
Guantanamo, a 45-square mile naval base in which the detention 
camp comprises some 3 acres. The sign touts the area's wildlife 
- the brown pelican, the Antillean manatee, the bottlenose 
dolphin, the hawksbill turtle.

  "Watching wildlife can be a lot of fun," says the sign. "A pair 
of binoculars is helpful."

  Last Wednesday, the 10th flight from Kandahar to the 
southeastern tip of Cuba arrived, bringing the total number of 
detainees at Camp X-Ray to 288. A day later, another 12 came, 
effectively filling the camp to capacity.

  Base officials allowed reporters to record audio and report the 
landings live via cell phone for the first time since the 
flights began arriving Jan. 11. They refused to allow cameras.

  The last time the Pentagon released pictures of the detainees - 
on their knees, wearing the goggles, and surrounded by guards - 
the images created an international uproar. Rights groups cried 
inhumane treatment.

  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld denied the allegations, 
insisting that the detainees have it better here than in 
Afghanistan.

  And he did what he routinely does when questioned about the way 
the United States is prosecuting the war on terrorism: He 
reminded critics of Sept. 11.

  When the detainees arrive at Camp X-Ray, they are told they're 
in Cuba and then undergo a 45-minute intake process, which, like 
the airstrip landing, is monitored by the Red Cross.

  The routine includes a delousing, or chemical washdown, and a 
physical. The detainees also get fingerprinted and photographed.

  They get a toothbrush, mint-flavored toothpaste, a bottle of 
"Lively Salon" antidandruff shampoo, soap, flip flops, a foam 
sleeping mat, two buckets, a washcloth, a canteen, a prayer cap, 
two blankets, a sheet, a Koran and two towels, one for praying.

  And, strangely, they get to write home. It's not that the U.S. 
military has a soft spot for the mothers of the Taliban or 
al-Qaida. Instead, base officials try to glean the prisoners' 
real names from the letters, as many tend to give multiple 
aliases during interrogations.

  When they're done, they're assigned to the cells in which they 
will begin their new lives. These are 8-feet-square, with 
chain-link sides and tin roofs. The Halogen lights stay on all 
night.

  The next day starts with prayer call about 5 a.m. A sign on a 
pole at the edge of the camp points the direction to Mecca. The 
prisoners come from 31 countries, including Saudi Arabia, Yemen, 
Pakistan, Algeria, England, Egypt, Australia, France, Russia, 
Belgium and Sweden. Base officials say there are Christian 
prisoners as well as Muslims.

  After prayer, the detainees' day goes like this: breakfast, a 
shower (every other day), sick call, noon prayer, lunch, 
recreation (15 minutes a couple of times a week), mail call, 
sunset prayer, dinner, evening prayer and bedtime around 9 p.m.

  Each meal the detainees get is considered halal, or religiously 
appropriate for Muslims. A typical breakfast includes oatmeal, 
an orange, fresh bread and a bottle of water. For lunch, it's 
pasta or vegetable stew, dry cereal including Froot Loops, a box 
of raisins, two granola bars, a bag of chips, and bag of peanuts 
and water.

  
For dinner they get white rice, red beans, a banana and water.

  U.S. Army Capt. Sean Campion, one of the camp guards, 
characterizes life at Camp X-Ray as "utter boredom."

  "If you do your job right," says Campion, 32, of Kansas City, 
Mo., "nothing is scheduled to happen."

  The guards mostly communicate with the prisoners via simple 
English commands and hand signals.

  "We're not holding any lengthy debates with them or anything," 
Campion says.

  Marine Corps Lt. Abuhena Mohammad Saiful-Islam, 39, speaks more 
with the detainees than almost anybody at the camp. As the 
Muslim chaplain, he ministers at the facility up to five hours 
every day.

  He says that with the start of the Muslim month of pilgrimage, 
during which the faithful journey to the holy city of Mecca, he 
detects more anxiety in the camp. Base officials are considering 
a special meal for March 10.

  "The role of chaplain is unique," Saiful-Islam says. "We don't 
go with a preconceived idea that the person is so and so. As a 
chaplain we approach them as a human being.

  
"We don't hate the sinner," he says, "but we hate the sin."

  Somebody asks Saiful-Islam if the relationship between the 
detainees and God has changed since their capture.

  "They haven't said that God has abandoned them, because they 
know," he says. "That's the hope that they have, that God is 
their only hope.

  "They do ask me what's going to happen. At this moment, I don't 
have an answer."

  Concertina wire and nine guard towers surround Camp X-Ray. The 
American flag is everywhere - painted on the guard towers, 
flying high in front of the facility.

  Unlike other parts of the base, the camp does not have a pretty 
setting. Turkey vultures hover over thick brush and scraggly 
hills.

  It is day two at X-Ray for the 34 newly arrived from Kandahar. A 
German shepherd and his handler patrol the camp's perimeter. 
Bright orange figures sit in their cells, some of them praying. 
One or two prisoners run for exercise in a fenced area, wearing 
handcuffs but no ankle shackles.

  Every so often a prisoner is led to one of five interrogation 
rooms, freshly built wood buildings with air conditioners and no 
windows. Three guards accompany him - one on either side and one 
behind.

  One of the guards puts a hand behind the head of the detainee, 
forcing him to look down. This is done to "provide positive 
control," says U.S. Army Col. Terry Carrico, in effect the 
prison warden.

  "It means he can't look ahead. He can't make a plan. They don't 
know where they're going. That's a technique across correctional 
facilities in the United States."

  Except for an occasional spitting incident or threat, officials 
say, the prisoners are docile. Base officials suspect that the 
people already in custody pass the word along to the new 
arrivals that they will be treated okay.

  "In the beginning, they were very unsure," says Carrico. "They 
didn't know if we were going to take care of them, hurt them or 
kill them."

  Some guards don't want to talk about their views of the 
prisoners. But U.S. Army Capt. Darrell Sides, 30, of Fort 
Benning, Ga., makes no bones about considering them terrorists.

  "We were all watching television Sept. 11," he says. "The 
security here I would consider tighter than death row in a 
prison in the United States."

  The morning run to Fleet Hospital 20 takes place as scheduled. 
This is for prisoners needing medical attention, as a fair 
number do. Some are underweight, others are missing toes, 
fingers and limbs.

  The hospital is several miles from Camp X-Ray, off Recreation 
Road. Along the way, if allowed, the detainees would get to see 
a bit of Americana, a portrait built over the past century.

  U.S. forces seized Guantanamo Bay during the Spanish-American 
War. In 1903, the U.S. government signed a lease with the 
Republic of Cuba. That contract, extended indefinitely in 1934, 
can be broken only by mutual agreement.

  The growth of the base has left Camp X-Ray surprisingly close to 
a suburban-style military community of beige, green and yellow 
houses in subdivisions with names like Caribbean Circle and West 
Iguana.

  Two boys in white karate outfits run down palm-lined Sherman 
Avenue. Another child, no more than 3 or 4, plays on a gym set, 
with a young woman keeping a watchful eye.

  Also up the road is the W.S. Sampson Elementary School, replete 
with yellow school buses, the Morale Welfare and Recreation 
Cooper Field with baseball and soccer fields, and the base's 
outdoor movie house, which is playing the movie, The Majestic.

  The 20-bed hospital is a high-tech, air-conditioned white tent 
which looks like a futuristic movie set, with low ceilings, 
fluorescent lighting, and padded white walls, floors and 
ceilings. The staff calls it a "temper tent."

  On this morning, U.S. Navy hospital corpsman Shuron Jerome, 19, 
of Houston is poring over a box of Valentines sent to Guantanamo 
by schoolchildren in Pennsylvania.

  
"Wish you could be with your family," one child has written.

  Jerome says the hospital feels no different than a hospital in 
the states, save for the high security and the various languages 
the detainees speak, including French, Russian, Urdu and Arabic. 
Most understand a little English, she says.

  While she sees the detainees as patients, she allows that 
they're not "regular patients." She often finds herself 
thinking, "Oh, my God, they could be related to this or related 
to that. But I still try to treat them as a patient."

  Fleet Hospital 20 has nine patients today. The bulk of the work 
includes blast and gunshot wounds from the war in Afghanistan.

  Just the other day, however, a surgeon took out the eye of a 
patient who had suffered a sports injury when he was younger. 
The pressure on the eye had become unbearable.

  The story got international play because it seemed to underscore 
the fact that tensions between the Americans and the detainees 
were easing. Indeed, the patient invited the surgeon for a cup 
of tea after the operation.

  The staff gives reporters a quick tour of the hospital, allowing 
photographs of some sections but not of the patients.

  As an al-Jazeera television crew walks through, the staff rolls 
out a patient who has just had his right index finger amputated 
as a result of a gunshot wound. The cameraman continues filming 
while a nurse covers the patient's face.

  In the recovery room, the patient's body starts trembling. The 
doctors explain this is a common reaction as patients awake from 
anesthesia. Still, it provides a bit of drama.

  "Michel! Michel!" yells a doctor still in her operating clothes. 
"You're doing good."

  Another doctor, speaking with a French accent, adds, "Good job, 
buddy."

  Finally, an interpreter comes in to talk to the patient. Eight 
other young-looking men, with shaved heads and beards growing, 
recover in their cots. Most of them sleep.

  The medical staff relies on linguists to help communicate with 
the patients, but they've also come up with their own 
inventions, such as a longhand list of English phrases and their 
Arabic counterparts. In a pinch, they show the patients the 
list, which includes the following phrases: I'm in pain. 
Thirsty. Hungry. Bathroom. Urinate. Arm. Hand. Leg. Back. IV 
Hurts. Cold. Hot. Sick, will throw up.

  While calm has returned to Fleet Hospital 20, officials 
elsewhere on the base are bracing for what they say may be 
inevitable: the death of one of the detainees. Not at the hands 
of the guards. But with 300 already in custody, and scores in 
poor health to begin with, they say something is bound to 
happen.

  In a briefing with reporters, Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Michael R. 
Lehnert, the commander of the prison project, says, "We continue 
to work to improve living conditions for both the detainees and 
our security forces."

  Within a couple months, he says, the operation will move to 
another part of Guantanamo called Radio Range, where utilities 
are more readily available and cells will have cots, air 
conditioning and toilets. The general is awaiting congressional 
approval before building for Radio Range begins.

  
For now, with the camp at capacity, flights here have stopped.


   Zambia hails result

 



  LUSAKA -- Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa yesterday hailed the 
re-election of his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe and 
called on defeated opponent Morgan Tsvangirai to accept the 
controversial result.

  "I am pleased to learn of the re-election of President Robert 
Mugabe as president of Zimbabwe," Mwanawasa said in a statement.

  "As chairman of the Organisation of African Unity and president 
of a friendly neighbour, I congratulate President Mugabe on his 
re-election," Mwanawasa said.

  Three of the 10 losing presidential candidates in Zambia's 
December 27 vote have petitioned the Supreme Court to nullify 
the results, charging that Mwanawasa won the election by fraud.

The Fall And Rise Of Hugo Chavez

 


Washington Times

The Fall And Rise Of Hugo Chavez

  In Venezuela, the dust is finally settling after the dramatic 
turbulence of the past two weeks. President Hugo Chavez is once 
again at the helm of power, and the military has returned to its 
barracks. But there are many grieving Venezuelans who aren't 
quite at peace. Their loved ones were gunned down, first by 
sympathizers of Mr. Chavez and subsequently by supporters of the 
short-lived interim government.

  Mr. Chavez was ousted in a military coup on April 12 after 17 
persons were killed during an anti-Chavez protest, apparently by 
sharpshooters faithful to the president. Pedro Carmona, a 
powerful businessman, stepped into power on Friday but was 
forced to resign the next day. Following the coup, 40 persons, 
mostly Chavez supporters, were killed while protesting.

  A probe of what transpired should be in the offing. Mr. Chavez 
has placed his cronies in every democratic institution, from 
congress to the courts, and is expected to prevent any honest 
inquiry. So far, Mr. Chavez appears complicit in the initial 
wave of killings. According to taped radio conversations 
broadcast yesterday in Venezuela on radio and television, Mr. 
Chavez ordered tanks and troops to surround the presidential 
palace, as unarmed civilian protesters marched against him on 
April 11. The Chavez administration said it ordered the 
deployment to "prevent public order disturbances." Given the 
death toll, Mr. Chavez's claims seem rather flimsy.

  This is most unfortunate. Venezuela is this hemisphere's 
second-oldest democracy. At a time when democracy is losing 
currency in many countries, particularly Argentina, coups could 
be potentially destabilizing to the region. "We are happy to 
collectively have overcome the era of coup d'etats in the 
region, and when events in Venezuela took on the appearance of a 
military coup there was a reaction by everyone," said Brazil's 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Mr. Cardoso's concerns are 
quite valid, but he has downplayed some of Mr. Chavez's more 
alarming faults.

  The Venezuelan leader has struck friendships with Cuban, Libyan 
and Iraqi leaders with great fanfare, and his open defiance of 
U.S. interests has wooed Venezuelans wary of U.S. power. Indeed, 
after all the muscle-flexing, Mr. Chavez has little to offer the 
Venezuelan people. He has choked off foreign investment by 
doubling the royalty payments oil companies must pay to the 
government and by restricting corporate ownership on some oil 
projects to 49 percent. He has also alienated workers at his 
country's state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, by 
replacing long-serving professionals with his supporters. In 
fact, Mr. Chavez consolidated his power by rewriting the 
country's constitution in 1999.

  Interestingly, Mr. Chavez initially rose to power in the 1990s 
because of the discontent with former President Carlos Andres 
Perez, who had ordered the military to shoot at crowds in 1989. 
And, while only time will tell if he would voluntarily give up 
power when his term in 2006, one thing is certain: A serious 
investigation of the massacre of April 2002 is certainly called 
for.


Mugabe wins poll, amid claims of rigging

 



  HARARE, March 13 (AFP) - Zimbabwe's long-time ruler Robert 
Mugabe swept to victory Wednesday in Presidential elections in a 
vote that challenger Morgan Tsvangirai declared was rigged and 
unacceptable.

  Registrar General Tobaiwa Mudede announced on state television 
that Mugabe was re-elected with 1,685,212 votes against 
1,258,758 votes for Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for 
Democratic Change (MDC).

  `I ... therefore declare Robert Mugabe the winner for the office 
of the presidency of Zimbabwe,' Mudede said.

  Observers had warned that should the outcome be seen to have 
been rigged, violence could explode across the volatile southern 
African nation.

  As the results were being announced, about 100 heavily armed 
soldiers moved into Zimbabwe's second city Bulawayao and 
surrounded the MDC offices, where opposition officials had 
gathered.

  Defence Minister Sydney Sekeramayi has put security forces on 
the highest level of alert, according to state media.

  Police roadblocks were seen on the main roads leading to central 
Harare, security forces were patrolling the city and six police 
officers were stationed outside MDC headquarters.

  
Tsvangirai rejected Mugabe's election victory out of hand.

  `The election was massively rigged,' he told a packed press 
conference. `We therefore as MDC do not accept this result.'

  Foreign governments all but dismissed the outcome even before it 
was announced, threatening to leave Mugabe internationally 
isolated despite his victory.

  British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw cited `pretty strong' 
evidence that Mugabe has `stolen' Zimbabwe's vote, an outcome he 
said would have `enormous implications for the nature of our 
relationship with Zimbabwe.'

  US State Department spokeswoman Lynn Cassel said: `While we must 
wait for the final results, it is abundantly clear that this was 
a seriously flawed election.'

  The MDC leadership was due to meet later Wednesday to discuss 
the poll results, and Tsvangirai was due to address a media 
conference afterwards.

  `We have a national executive meeting ... where we will be 
looking at the figures and give the reaction of the party,' said 
David Coltart, an MDC MP.

  `To put it mildly the figures are very odd, with very low 
turnouts in the cities and massive ones in the rural areas, 
which is unprecedented in this country,' he said.

  Polling stations in Harare were reduced by 32 per cent in favour 
of an increase of voting outlets in rural areas, considered 
Mugabe's support base.

  Of 882,176 people registered to vote in Harare Province, 439,656 
or 49.8 per cent actually did so during the three days of 
polling that began Saturday and saw mile-long queues across the 
capital.

  The MDC, charging that the Mugabe government had followed a 
deliberate strategy of impeding the urban vote, went to the High 
Court and won an extra day of voting on Monday, but polls opened 
several hours late, and only an additional 24,000 votes were 
cast.

  The election is the hardest fought battle for Zimbabwe's top 
post since liberation war hero Mugabe took over after 
independence from Britain in 1980.

  `The election was preceded by months of government-orchestrated 
violence meant to intimidate voters (and) the opposition was 
repeatedly harassed and prevented from campaigning,' she said.

  Turnout across the southern African country was an estimated 66 
per cent in an election fraught by violence, intimidation and 
intense legal wrangling over civic rights and electoral rules.

  Even after the polls closed Monday, Mugabe's government kept up 
the pressure on the opposition by charging MDC Secretary General 
Welshman Ncube with high treason, which the party dismissed as a 
smear tactic. Ncube, along with Tsvangirai and four other top 
party officials, had been accused last month of plotting to 
assassinate the President.

  The tumultuous campaign grabbed international headlines and 
sparked diplomatic rows that landed Mugabe with sanctions from 
the European Union and the United States. Violence has claimed 
at least 33 lives, mostly those of opposition supporters, since 
the start of the year.

  The influential International Crisis Group (ICG) warned that the 
`risk of major violence erupting is exceedingly high' if the 
election was seen to be rigged.




   Mugabe won polls unfairly says West

 



  President Rob-ert Mugabe swept back to power in Zimbabwe 
yesterday after an election fiercely condemned by local 
monitors, the opposition and the West but praised by African 
nations.

  Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, easily beaten by the 
veteran president according to official results, said Mugabe had 
stolen the vote through violence and intimidation and by 
preventing hundreds of thousands of people from voting.

  The US said the election, extending Mugabe's 22-year rule for 
another six years, was "fundamentally flawed". Zimbabwe had 
ignored its commitment to a free and fair poll.

  Two State Department officials said Washington aimed to impose 
financial restrictions against any assets in the US held by 
Mugabe and senior members of his government but could not say 
when they would take effect.

  A deep split appeared between Western nations and African 
countries monitoring the vote, who closed ranks behind Mugabe, 
calling the election legitimate.

  Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede declared Mugabe the winner 
after results were in from all 120 constituencies. He said the 
former guerilla won his fifth term as leader after taking 
1,685,212 votes against 1,258,401 for Tsvangirai.

  The opposition leader said his Movement for Democratic Change 
(MDC) would not accept the result.

  "The election results ... do not reflect the true will of the 
people of Zimbabwe and are consequently illegitimate," he said.

  Norwegian and local observers said thousands of people, mostly 
in opposition strongholds, had been prevented from voting.

  But observers from South Africa, Namibia and Nigeria all said 
Mugabe's re-election was legitimate.

  South Africa and Nigeria together with Australia comprise a 
special Commonwealth group given the power to take measures 
against Zimbabwe if the election is deemed not to have been free 
and fair.

  Zimbabwe security forces went on high alert and erected 
roadblocks around Harare after the result was announced.

  The MDC said dozens of heavily armed soldiers had surrounded its 
office in the second city of Bulawayo. Small groups of armed 
riot police moved into Harare townships loyal to Tsvangirai.

  Several hundred Mugabe supporters danced in celebration and 
carried mock coffins for Tsvangirai in two Harare townships. One 
of the coffins was draped in the US flag.

  
Mugabe's government dismissed criticism of the election.

  Information Minister Jonathan Moyo said the result was a blow to 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair whom Mugabe accuses of 
sponsoring Tsvangirai.

  The former colonial power Britain said that Mugabe had held on 
to power through a "systematic campaign of violence and 
intimidation". Forward this article to a Colleague, Associate or

   US-Japan climate talks end

 



  Representatives from Japan and the United States have finished 
two days of talks Tuesday on climate change in Tokyo.

  They discussed ways of co-operating in the science and 
technology fields to prevent global warming.

  The meeting was the first between the two countries since 
President George Bush unveiled a new US plan calling for 
voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic 
growth rather than mandatory targets.

  At the start of the meeting, the US said it would promote 
research and development into climate change.

  
Japan says it still intends to ratify the Kyoto protocol.

  President Bush caused an international outcry when he rejected 
the 1997 Kyoto protocol on climate change last year, saying it 
hindered US economic growth.

Zimbabwe's rigged election

 



  The election this week in Zimbabwe was an ugly travesty from 
which all of southern Africa will suffer. Voters lined up for 
hours at polling stations, many of them in vain. Supporters of 
the main opposition candidate were intimidated and beaten. Then 
the long-serving, increasingly tyrannical president, Robert 
Mugabe, was declared the winner. International observers called 
the process deeply flawed, and the Bush administration has 
refused to recognize the declared results.

  Unfortunately, some leading African countries like South Africa 
and Nigeria have compounded the problem by accepting Mugabe's 
victory despite earlier assertions that they would not recognize 
the results of a rigged election. By failing to hold firm they 
not only damage their diplomatic credibility, but also ignore 
the consequences for nearby African states of Mugabe's misrule. 
These include explosive political frustration, a swelling tide 
of desperate refugees and a growing reluctance by foreign 
companies and donors to invest in the region. Washington and 
other Western governments may now strengthen the current mild 
sanctions against Zimbabwe. These steps would be far more 
effective if they were joined by major African states.

  Mugabe, who led Zimbabwe's liberation struggle against white 
minority rule in the late 1970's, has systematically wrecked his 
country's economy and its freedoms to prolong his 22-year-old 
hold on power. Zimbabwe should be an economic beacon, not a 
basket case. It is blessed with fertile agricultural land, and 
during the first dozen years of Mugabe's rule it was relatively 
prosperous and free.

  That picture changed radically in the mid-1990's when Mugabe 
shifted onto a highly destructive course. He incited violent 
land seizures that have taken a disastrous toll on agricultural 
investment and production and launched a broad assault on 
journalistic freedom and judicial independence. This campaign 
has been carried out with help from a small but loyal core of 
former liberation fighters turned thugs. Thugs and fraud cannot 
keep the 78-year-old Mugabe in power forever. Zimbabwe's 
recovery will have to wait for his departure.

Mugabe Wins Despite Biased Propaganda

 



  
TEHRAN TIMES INTL. DESK

  TEHRAN -- President Robert Mugabe easily won Zimbabwe's election 
on Wednesday despite biased propaganda unleashed against him by 
some Western countries, accusing him of being unfair towards the 
opposition.

  Results announced by Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede at 0800 
GMT showed Mugabe with 1,634,382 votes, well past the 50 percent 
of ballots cast that he needed to extend his 22-year rule for 
six more year.

  His challenger, former trade unionist Morgan Tsvangirai, trailed 
almost half a million votes behind. Mudede said 3.1 million 
people voted in the three-day election.

  There were fears of a violent reaction from Tsvangirai's 
supporters, and security forces were put on high alert and 
police put up road blocks on approach roads to the capital 
Harare.

  Australia said it feared violence if voters thought the election 
had been stolen. Canberra is a member of a Three-Nation 
Commonwealth task force monitoring the election.

  Tsvangirai, saying Mugabe has destroyed the economy of the once 
prosperous nation, accused the president of systematically 
stealing the election to hide his deep unpopularity with voters, 
Reuters reported.

  Mugabe's government has dismissed criticism of the poll, which 
Information Minister Jonathan Moyo called "exemplary".

  Western countries queued up to condemn the election in which the 
78-year-old president faced his first real challenge.

  The United States, condemning the reduction of polling stations 
in opposition urban strongholds, said the election was 
"seriously flawed" and riddled with irregularities.

  Australia and Britain led an unsuccessful call for commonwealth 
sanctions against Mugabe before the election.

  New Zealand said on Wednesday it was ready to impose sanctions 
against Zimbabwe if the commonwealth decided not to suspend the 
country after the vote.




Bush's Policy on Argentina Signals Shift in Approach

 



  WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 - Seven years ago this month, President Bill 
Clinton's economic advisers told him Mexico was hours away from 
economic default and perhaps chaos on the streets. Mr. Clinton 
ordered an unpopular multibillion-dollar bailout, over the 
objections of Congress, but with the support of a prominent 
Republican governor, George W. Bush of Texas.

  When Argentina barreled toward a similar default in recent 
weeks, it was Mr. Bush who had to make the bailout call - and 
his decision was to let Argentina suffer the consequences of its 
own economic mismanagement. His aides argue that the 
circumstances were somewhat different: Mexico appeared ready to 
make reforms but needed time and cash, while Argentina had not 
heeded repeated warnings that its policies were leading to 
financial disaster.

  Still, Mr. Bush's reaction to the biggest international economic 
crisis so far in his presidency is a telling example of a new - 
and perhaps risky - approach to the kind of national economic 
bankruptcies that dominated Washington's dealings with the 
world's emerging markets in the late 1990's.

  The Clinton administration, fearing "economic contagion," was 
willing to back loans to teetering governments in Thailand, 
Indonesia, South Korea and Russia. But Mr. Bush's aides have 
adopted a policy some call "tough love," meant to reverse the 
expectation in capitals around the world that if you are big 
enough, or strategically important, Washington will always find 
a way to prevent fiscal and political collapse.

  Mr. Bush promised just such a policy during his presidential 
campaign. But the first time his approach was tested, when 
Turkey ran into deep trouble last spring, Mr. Bush's national 
security aides warned that it was no time to abandon a 
well-located ally whose government seemed willing to take the 
medicine the International Monetary Fund prescribed. Washington 
joined in the bailout.

  "It's fair to say," one senior administration official noted 
during the last week, "that while we have been clear, we haven't 
always been consistent."

  The hard line on Argentina, White House and Treasury officials 
say, was calculated to send the message that under the Bush 
administration, the United States would be a reluctant financial 
firefighter and that the markets should not bet on a bailout. It 
is a message that Mr. Bush's aides said in interviews this week 
that they hoped would force officials of developing countries 
and foreign investors to work out their problems without relying 
as much on huge aid packages from the International Monetary 
Fund and from Washington, which became commonplace after Mexico.

  "It is a different approach, but we needed a different 
approach," said John B. Taylor, undersecretary of the Treasury 
for international affairs. "We want to follow a policy that does 
not bail out bondholders and improves the market over all."

  
There are other new aspects to the Bush policy.

  Treasury officials in the Clinton era never shied away from 
dispensing a steady stream of advice to countries on the 
condition that they would have to meet to get Western aid. In 
contrast, during the Argentina crisis, Treasury Secretary Paul 
H. O'Neill was nearly invisible, rarely commenting on the 
country's approaching default, or the violent protests that led 
to the resignation of President Fernando de la R?  Officials say Mr. O'Neill supported the decision by the I.M.F. 
to cut off Argentina's loans because it had failed to meet the 
fund's demands for fiscal restraint. And now Washington's 
message to Argentina's new president, Eduardo Duhalde, is 
straightforward: Come up with a workable plan, and then we will 
talk.

  "President Bush never talked about specific steps he expected 
the Argentine government to take," said one White House official 
familiar with Mr. Bush's periodic calls and letters to Mr. de la 
R?d the series of his successors in recent weeks. "You won't 
find this administration having those kinds of conversations. 
Argentina has to come up with what works for them, and if we can 
support it, we will."

  Mr. Bush's approach carries considerable risk. There is every 
possibility that Argentina's new government will abandon the 
free-market leanings, tight fiscal and banking controls the 
country embraced with strong International Monetary Fund support 
over the last decade. Already there is considerable doubt that 
Argentina will now agree to the kind of hemispheric free-trade 
agreement that Mr. Bush himself, with Mr. de la R? his side, 
said last year was a major goal of his administration.

  Both the I.M.F. and the United States, the fund's largest 
shareholder, have come under some sharp criticism for denying 
new loans to Argentina after previously approving aid to the 
country. The last emergency loan was put together in August, 
with Mr. O'Neill's close supervision.

  The critics of Mr. Bush's decision to pull the plug on aid argue 
that the I.M.F. and the Bush administration were callous for 
abandoning an ally at a sensitive moment. And some argue that 
both the Clinton and Bush administrations should have acted 
sooner to steer Argentina away from its doomed efforts to defend 
a 1-to-1 peg of its peso to the dollar.

  But administration and I.M.F. officials respond that they aided 
Argentina for as long as they thought there was a reasonable 
chance that its political leaders were serious about reform. 
They pulled the plug, one senior administration official said, 
"only when it became clear that the collapse was going to happen 
sooner or later, and there was no use spending billions to get a 
few more weeks before the inevitable happened."

  Some longtime critics of the fund applauded the Bush 
administration's stance. Both left-wing anti-globalization 
activists and some conservative economists have argued that the 
fund became too interventionist during the Clinton years. That 
allowed investors to make reckless bets on the assumption that 
lending agencies would rescue them when things went wrong.

  "I am hopeful that we're in transition to a world in which 
countries and lenders learn more about risk," said Allan H. 
Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University, who headed a 
Congressional panel two years ago that advocated sweeping 
changes at the I.M.F. and the World Bank. "You can't just keep 
throwing money at these problems and hope they will go away."

Rumsfeld Defends U.S. Treatment of Detainees in Cuba

 



  WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 - Frustrated by an international outcry over 
the American treatment of prisoners in Cuba, Secretary of 
Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld defended the United States' conduct 
at length today and dismissed the criticism as breathless 
armchair hyperbole.

  "I am telling you what I believe in every inch of my body to be 
the truth, and I have spent a lot of time on secure video with 
the people down there," he told reporters, referring to the 
United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where 158 
prisoners from the war in Afghanistan are being jailed. "I 
haven't found a single scrap of any kind of information that 
suggests that anyone has been treated anything other than 
humanely."

  Mr. Rumsfeld spoke in an unusual briefing that stretched over an 
hour in an attempt, he said, to "tap down some of this 
hyperbole." It was prompted by a rising tide of international 
criticism after the Defense Department released photographs over 
the weekend that showed some of the prisoners kneeling before 
their captors, their legs in shackles, their hands bound in 
manacles, their mouths covered by surgical masks and their eyes 
blinded by large goggles with black tape.

  His comments came as criticism swelled from abroad. Critics said 
the United States was using sensory deprivation and other 
psychological control techniques to weaken the prisoners so that 
interrogations would be more fruitful. The International 
Committee of the Red Cross, in a rare break with its code of not 
publicly criticizing detaining governments, said the United 
States might have violated Geneva Convention rules against 
making a spectacle of prisoners by distributing the pictures, 
which were published worldwide.

  Amnesty International sought access to the prisoners in 
Guantanamo and said they should be allowed to have lawyers.

  "Keeping prisoners incommunicado, sensory deprivation, the use 
of unnecessary restraint and the humiliation of people through 
tactics such as shaving them are all classic techniques employed 
to break the spirit of individuals ahead of interrogation," the 
organization said.

  Several governments joined the chorus, saying the prisoners 
should be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva 
Convention. Such status would accord them the highest level of 
protections.

  Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief, said 
that despite the Sept. 11 atrocities, "changing our values and 
our way of life would be terrorism's first victory." The 
Netherlands also urged Washington to recognize the detainees as 
prisoners of war, saying, "In the fight, we need to uphold our 
norms and values."

  While debate raged elsewhere, Britain and Spain supported the 
United States. Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said the three 
British prisoners at the detention center, called Camp X-Ray, 
"had no complaints about their treatment." Spanish Foreign 
Minister Josep Pique said the Spanish government "does not have 
the slightest doubt regarding the position of the U.S. 
government."

  The warden at Camp X-Ray, Col. Terry Carrico, said he was 
determined at all times to maintain what he called "positive 
control" over the prisoners. Bill Nash, a retired Army major 
general and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, 
said this amounted to "imposing on them a psychological sense of 
isolation, domination and futility, and trying to establish the 
conditions by which you can then reward them for information, as 
oppose to punish them."

  Mr. Rumsfeld said it was "probably unfortunate" that the 
photographs were released, at least without an explanation. He 
said the prisoners had been photographed in a holding area just 
before their restraints were removed and they were put in their 
cages.

  "If you want to think the worst about things, you can," he said. 
But he argued that whenever prisoners, especially those who are 
dangerous and suicidal, are transported, it only makes sense to 
lock them in restraints. "When they are being moved from place 
to place, will they be restrained in a way so that they are less 
likely to be able to kill an American soldier? You bet. Is it 
inhumane to do that? No. Would it be stupid to do anything else? 
Yes."

  It is not clear why the United States has not officially 
designated the detainees as prisoners of war, especially since 
Mr. Rumsfeld said they are essentially being treated as such.

  "They're in legal limbo," said Michael F. Noone, professor of 
military law at Catholic University. "The United States has to 
get moving on screening these people and determining whether or 
not they're P.O.W.'s. There is no explanation for the delay."

  Mr. Rumsfeld said the Pentagon's clear priority with the 
prisoners was to extract information from them to prevent future 
attacks. "These people are committed terrorists," he said. "We 
are keeping them off the street and out of the airlines and out 
of nuclear power plants and out of ports across this country and 
across other countries."

  And yet, officials at Guantanamo have said that no interrogation 
has taken place on the base and that the prisoners do not have 
lawyers.

  Asked what benefit the United States gets by not classifying the 
captives as prisoners of war, Mr. Rumsfeld said, "I don't know 
enough of the legal technicalities to answer your question. I 
know that the process of gathering the intelligence information 
has not been concluded."

  Mr. Rumsfeld said one of the complicating factors was that the 
Geneva Conventions give protection to prisoners from countries 
but not from terrorist organizations, like Al Qaeda, to which 
some of the prisoners apparently belong. "To give standing under 
a Geneva Convention to a terrorist organization that's not a 
country is something that I think some of the lawyers who did 
not drop out of law school as I did worry about as a precedent," 
he said.

  Officials have said the prisoners come from a range of 
countries, - Britain, Yemen, China, Saudi Arabia and Australia 
among them - and that has also complicated the legal picture.

  In Los Angeles, a federal district judge questioned today 
whether he had the authority to consider a challenge to the 
detention of the prisoners in Cuba.

  "I have grave doubts about whether I have jurisdiction," said 
the judge, A. Howard Matz. He spoke at a hearing on a petition 
filed on Sunday by a group of lawyers, clerics and professors 
who demand that the detainees be identified, taken before a 
court and told of the charges against them.

U.S. Closely Monitoring Situation in Argentina

 



  The Bush administration was closely monitoring the situation in 
Argentina where escalating economic crisis led to a wave of 
bloody street violence and looting, the White House said on 
Thursday.

  "Argentina is a valued ally and friend, and the United States is 
monitoring developments in Argentina. We are concerned about the 
events," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters at a 
regular news briefing.

  Argentine President Fernando De la Rua declared a national state 
of siege Wednesday night and ordered additional security forces 
into the streets to control violence that left at least six 
people dead and hundreds wounded or arrested. It was Argentina's 
worst unrest in a decade.

Angry at Vote, Commonwealth Bars Zimbabwe

 



  LONDON, March 19 - Flanked by the presidents of South Africa and 
Nigeria, Prime Minister John Howard of Australia today announced 
a yearlong suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, a group 
of 54 nations, mostly former British colonies. The unusual step 
was meant to punish President Robert Mugabe for his stewardship 
of elections this month that were widely criticized outside 
Africa as rigged.

  The two African leaders, Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and 
Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, maintained a cryptic silence while 
Mr. Howard spoke, endorsing the decision by their presence at a 
news conference but avoiding embroilment in a debate over 
whether they now view Mr. Mugabe's presidency as illegitimate.

  While less than an expulsion, the move still deepened the 
diplomatic isolation of Zimbabwe, which has already been 
battered by political violence, hunger, economic decline and the 
threat of labor unrest. It means Zimbabwean officials will be 
barred from meetings held by the Commonwealth, an organization 
that carries some cachet as an important club bridging the 
north-south divide.

  The suspension was decided by the three men, who met as a 
committee charged with deciding the Commomwealth's response. The 
decision, made at the headquarters in Marlborough House, has 
left two of the men facing an acute dilemma.

  Mr. Mbeki and Mr. Obasanjo - both of whose countries have under 
past undemocratic regimes been excluded from the Commonwealth - 
are torn between solidarity with a fellow African leader who was 
a crusader against colonialism, and their commitment to 
democratic standards as part of African economic regeneration. 
Mr. Howard was chairman of the three-nation committee.

  The move avoids an open rift between its majority members in 
Africa and Asia, some of which have tended to side with Mr. 
Mugabe, and rich, white-ruled countries like Britain, Canada and 
Australia, which have criticized him. Yet it adds one more voice 
to those labeling Mr. Mugabe a pariah and increasing pressure on 
him to seek reconciliation, possibly through new elections.

  The opprobrium spread further today when Switzerland became the 
latest country to impose sanctions on Zimbabwe, "in view of the 
manipulation of the presidential elections and ongoing human 
rights violations," the Swiss government said.

  Under other restrictions, Mr. Mugabe and Zimbabwe's most senior 
leaders are already barred from travel to the United States and 
the European Union.

  "The committee has decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils 
of the Commonwealth for a period of one year with immediate 
effect," Mr. Howard said, reading the statement alone, 
apparently as a face-saving gesture to Mr. Mbeki, whose own 
election observers in Zimbabwe found the vote "legitimate."

  The response to Mr. Mugabe's behavior was seen by many outsiders 
as a token of South Africa's and Nigeria's own commitment to 
democracy as a way of fostering economic renewal. At a meeting 
in Monterrey, Mexico, for instance, the financier George Soros 
said today that the Zimbabwe elections "have cast doubt on the 
ability of the African states to create suitable conditions for 
private investment."

  If the Commonwealth had not suspended Zimbabwe - an act Mr. 
Howard saw as "at the severe end" of available punishments - 
such criticism would only have sharpened. Yet many African 
politicians, including Morgan Tsvangirai, the Zimbabwe 
opposition leader defeated in the election, had expressed doubt 
that the Commonwealth would take any action at all.

  The suspension was accompanied by suggestions for easing 
Zimbabwe's drastic food shortages and economic decline. The 
Commonwealth also supported moves to resolve the country's 
violent crisis over the seizure of white farmers' land, backing 
Mr. Mugabe in his commitment to redistribute territory among 
landless black Zimbabweans. This was apparently intended to keep 
the door open to dialogue.

  "Land is at the core of the crisis in Zimbabwe," Mr. Howard said 
in his statement.

  According to the statement, the leaders of South Africa and 
Nigeria will continue to talk to Mr. Mugabe about ways to lift 
the suspension.

  For all its critics say it is ineffective, the Commonwealth has 
nonetheless sought to project itself as an arbiter of democratic 
legitimacy among often delinquent members.

  In the 60's, white-ruled South Africa quit the Commonwealth 
rather than be suspended over apartheid; Nigeria was suspended 
in the 1990's during military rule because of the execution of 
the human rights activist Ken Saro Wiwa. Fiji has been suspended 
twice, once for 10 years. Pakistan has been suspended since the 
military coup two years ago that brought Gen. Pervez Musharraf 
to power.

Finance Minister of Argentina Resigns Post

 



  The uncertainty of Argentina's precarious financial situation 
deepened yesterday when Daniel Marx, the finance secretary, 
resigned.

  Mr. Marx stepped down as Argentina paid $700 million in 
short-term debt owed to local banks by forcing pension funds to 
buy government bonds. The payment was the first of two in 
December that would hold off a default on its public debt.. 
Argentina has been struggling to contain its public debt, now 
totaling about $132 billion, after four years of recession.

  In discussing his decision, Mr. Marx suggested that it was time 
for someone else to oversee the government's negotiations with 
its creditors. "It's a cycle," he said. "I had also some 
personal things to deal with."

  Mr. Marx added that he would still work with the government, in 
a capacity that had not yet been formalized. "I agreed to 
continue to work on the national debt issues for Argentina," he 
said.

  In the last few weeks, working with the economy minister, 
Domingo Cavallo, Mr. Marx had been trying to persuade 
Argentina's foreign creditors to accept lower interest rates on 
existing debts. Domestic creditors already agreed, under some 
duress, to swap roughly $40 billion in obligations for new 
loans. Mr. Marx said that his foreign consultations had been 
proceeding "according to schedule."

  There was no doubt, however, that Mr. Marx's job had recently 
become tougher. The International Monetary Fund decided last 
week to delay the release of $1.3 billion in aid, which is 
needed to cover a budget shortfall. During the last few months, 
political infighting has eroded the government's ability to 
adhere to the zero-deficit rule favored by the I.M.F. and 
promised by Mr. Cavallo.

  Mr. Marx's resignation also followed a national strike on 
Thursday by union members, shopkeepers and unemployed workers, 
which brought the country close to a standstill. The strikers 
were protesting federal budget cuts and restrictions on 
withdrawals from bank accounts.

  Mr. Cavallo instituted the banking controls on Dec. 1 to stave 
off a run on Argentina's banks. Depositors who worried that the 
peso's fixed one-to-one exchange rate with the dollar was about 
to be broken by a devaluation, despite Mr. Cavallo's insistence 
to the contrary, were withdrawing dollars from bank accounts. A 
sudden, widespread drop in deposits threatened to choke economic 
activity and worsen the country's financial troubles.

  The controls were a sign of the financial pressures on 
Argentina, according to Vincent Truglia, an analyst at Moody's 
(news/quote). "They were indicative of the very difficult 
situation that the country was in and continues to be in," he 
said.

  Mr. Marx declined to say in an interview whether he had favored 
imposing the restrictions.

  Mr. Marx became finance secretary in December 1999 after a 
career in private finance and a stint on the board of 
Argentina's central bank. The finance secretary is effectively 
the economy minister's deputy, with specific responsibility for 
the public debt.

  Mr. Marx kept his job through the resignation and replacement of 
two economy ministers, Jose Luis Machinea and Ricardo 
Lopez-Murphy, and the return of Mr. Cavallo to government. His 
technical knowledge and strong relations with Argentina's 
foreign creditors won him considerable respect at home and 
abroad.

  Mr. Marx is known for favoring market-based rather than 
regulatory solutions to economic problems, a reputation shared 
by Julio Dreizzen, who resigned as finance undersecretary on 
Oct. 29, citing personal reasons.

  Mr. Marx's departure may pave the way for Miguel Kiguel, an 
economist from the Justicialist opposition party, to join Mr. 
Cavallo's team. On Thursday, Argentina's president, Fernando de 
la Rua  met with Carlos Sa?nem, a former president and 
leader of the Justicialists, to discuss economic strategy. The 
appointment of Mr. Kiguel to succeed Mr. Marx may be seen as a 
way to bring the Justicialists into Mr. De La Rua's ruling 
coalition, forming a sort of national unity government to 
address the economy.

   Argentina braces for currency fall

 



  BUENOS AIRES - Nostalgia runs deep in Argentina. Even before its 
faltering economy produced an epic-sized default, and the 
country was thrust into its worst crisis since democracy was 
restored in 1983, Argentines were obsessed with their past 
triumphs.

  But now a different variety of nostalgia appears to be emerging. 
Some call it the Ford Falcon syndrome, a reference to the 
classic gas-guzzler that inefficient Argentine automakers 
continued to turn out in droves 20 years after it disappeared 
from US showrooms.

  The man whom some economists say is leading the step backward in 
time is the country's new president, Eduardo Duhalde, 
Argentina's fifth in two weeks. After four years of crippling 
recession, Duhalde and others are questioning whether 
Argentina's decade-long pursuit of free market reforms is the 
right solution.

  With his appointment by Congress last Wednesday to finish the 
two years left in the term vacated by ex-President Fernando de 
la R?he Peronist Duhalde is now promoting a number of 
emergency measures that would turn back the clock on liberal 
economic reforms.

  On Friday, President Duhalde asked Congress for broad new powers 
to end the country's decade-old currency regime that pegs the 
peso to the US dollar, to intervene in the banking system, to 
institute price controls, and to protect local industry and 
jobs. It was approved overwhelmingly by the lower house of 
Congress late Saturday and was expected to be passed by the 
Senate yesterday.

  Everyone from the International Monetary Fund in Washington to 
the traditional protectionists in Buenos Aires thought 
devaluation was necessary, if painful. But some analysts are 
concerned that Duhalde will follow it up with a return to the 
protectionism and failed policies that dominated the country's 
economy for half of this past century, until ex-President Carlos 
Menem changed course last decade and ushered in an era of 
stability.

  "He must think he can defy gravity, because he's pursuing the 
same crash course that Argentines and the rest of Latin America 
rejected a decade ago," says Christopher Ecclestone, head of 
investment boutique Buenos Aires Trust.

  Duhalde's embrace of the past can be partly explained by the 
nature of the Peronists themselves, whom Argentine literary 
giant Jorge Luis Borges once referred to as neither good nor 
bad, just incorrigible.

  The party, founded by Gen. Juan Domingo Peron in the 1940s, has 
long dominated Argentine politics, thanks to a deft mix of 
populist policies, nationalist rhetoric, and political 
patronage. A weekend poll by Aresco consultancy showed 52 
percent of Argentines "highly" in favor of Duhalde's stated 
economic plans and another 34 percent giving him "medium" 
approval - an indication of public confidence.

  But at a time when the country is desperate for investment and 
international aid to prevent an economic crisis from exploding 
further, it is unclear how far Duhalde could actually turn back 
the clock even if he wanted to.

  For starters, there's a wariness among economists that an 
expected 30 to 40 percent devaluation could spark a return to 
the chaotic days of the late 1980s, when 5,000-percent inflation 
was rampant. Already, everything from bread to computer parts 
has been marked up by as much as 20 percent in anticipation of 
the devaluation.

  To contain inflation and fill an expected $11 billion budget 
deficit this year, government officials say a rescue package of 
at least $15 billion is needed from the IMF and other lenders. 
Otherwise, the country's cash-strapped banks, which are being 
forced to accept lesser-valued pesos for loans made almost 
entirely in dollars, will collapse.

  But few expect the government's plan for reviving the country's 
moribund economy to elicit much support abroad. In fact, quite 
the contrary.

  Already a swarm of powerful lobbies representing foreign 
companies have descended on Buenos Aires to fight government 
plans to introduce price and capital controls. The government is 
also taking heat for its plans to violate privatization 
contracts signed a decade ago and unilaterally lower the rates 
mostly foreign-owned utilities can charge for public services 
like water and gas.

  "He's not just steering the economy into disaster, but he's 
breaking fundamental concepts like right to savings and the rule 
of law," says Abel Viglione, senior economist at local think 
tank Fiel. "No matter what economic policy is in place, that 
sort of trust takes several years, if not an entire generation, 
to rebuild."

  But the stiffest opposition may yet come from the Argentines 
themselves. Despite widespread fatigue caused by successive 
austerity drives, such as limiting bank withdrawals to $1,000 
per month, the overwhelming majority of Argentines still prefer 
the stability of the current economic model - despite its many 
shortcomings - to the disorder of a closed economy.

  Surveys show that more than 70 percent of the public opposes any 
changes to convertibility, as the currency regime is known.

  "Those who want to devalue are shameless," says Maria Estevez, a 
schoolteacher who earns $600 a month. "They want to hold us 
hostage and force us to buy goods that can be bought cheaper and 
better quality imported."

  Instead of blaming globalization, most Argentines point to 
corrupt politicians and indifferent institutions for 
precipitating the current crisis.

  For such an ambitious economic program to work requires a strong 
leader with popular support to implement it. But that's exactly 
what Duhalde most lacks. Although he's so far successfully 
rallied the country's political class behind him, Duhalde, a 
former vice president to Menem and two-time governor of Buenos 
Aires province, has been dogged by allegations of corruption 
throughout his career. His reputation as an old-style party boss 
was behind his defeat at the polls in 1999, when he posted the 
worst showing ever by a Peronist presidential candidate.

Ministry Criticizes 'Odious' U.S. Report

 



  The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it was "surprised, to 
put it mildly" by the U.S. State Department's criticism of 
Russia's human rights record and objected in particular to the 
"odious" section on Chechnya.

  "One gets the impression that its writers simply used old 
drafts, as if nothing had happened in either Russia or the 
United States in recent years, as if the events of Sept. 11, 
2001 had not occurred and the international community had not 
closed ranks in the battle against terrorism," the ministry said 
in a statement.

  The State Department's annual human rights report, which was 
published Monday, said Russia had a poor record regarding the 
independence and freedom of the media and in Chechnya. Russian 
security forces in Chechnya have "demonstrated little respect 
for basic human rights and there were credible reports of 
serious violations, including numerous reports of extrajudicial 
killings by both the government and Chechen fighters," the 
report said.

  Russian officials from President Vladimir Putin on down have 
portrayed the conflict in Chechnya as a war against 
international terrorists. U.S. officials have partially endorsed 
that view, pointing to rebel leaders such as Shamil Basayev and 
the Jordanian-born Omar Ibn al Khattab, who are believed to have 
financial and other ties to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorist 
network.

  However, U.S. officials also note that some of the rebels do not 
have international ties, and they have criticized Russian 
military and police abuse of civilians -- although the criticism 
was toned down greatly after Russia became an enthusiastic 
member of the anti-terrorist coalition, sharing intelligence 
information, opening its airspace to humanitarian flights and 
giving a green light to U.S. military deployment in Central 
Asia.

  The Foreign Ministry said that the State Department 
pronouncement on Chechnya reflected the efforts of "certain 
circles" in the United States that object to the new 
U.S.-Russian partnership against international terrorism.

  "These circles have persistently tried to reanimate the 'Chechen 
problem,' and turn it again into an irritant in the 
Russian-American dialogue," the ministry said.

  The ministry also suggested that before judging others' rights 
records, the United States should investigate the situation at 
home, including the government's failure to ratify some 
international human rights agreements and the use of the death 
penalty. Russia introduced a moratorium on capital punishment, a 
prerequisite for joining the Council of Europe, in 1996.




Guantanamo's Unhappy Campers

Guantanamo's Unhappy Campers

  
The only abuse the detainees are experiencing is self-inflicted.

  
By Matt Labash

  GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA -- It's 5 A.M. at the Roosevelt Roads Naval 
station in Puerto Rico, and 20 journalists straggle to the gate 
in sleep-deprived silence to catch a plane to Guantanamo Bay. 
Many of us haven't been up this early in years. But after flying 
thousands of miles, then pub-crawling through the streets of Old 
San Juan last night, we are here because our military escorts 
insist we show up at this time, though the flight actually 
leaves four hours later. "The military operates on one 
principle," explains a savvy veteran: "Hurry up and wait."

  If we're not happy, that goes double for our public affairs 
babysitters. "I'm up to my ears in Vieques," says Navy Lt. Corey 
Barker, of the nearby bombing range/public relations fiasco that 
has been protested by everyone from Al Sharpton to obscure 
Kennedys. Now, Barker is stuck minding us as we light out for 
Guantanamo, the American naval station on the southeastern tip 
of Cuba. It is there that 158 al Qaeda/Taliban prisoners are 
being detained because, depending on who you ask, it is an 
ideal, sunny clime, it's not subject to the get-out-of-jail 
escape hatches of U.S. federal law, or because, as one senior 
Pentagon official says, "The lawyers didn't want to go on 
14-hour flights to some guano rock in the Pacific."

  Inside the air terminal, our baggage handlers check us in with 
the efficiency of Bulgarian DMV workers. A sign on the wall says 
"Air Terminal of the Year 2000." "I'd hate to see who got second 
place," whispers one reporter. As we wait for our flight on a 
creaky Pan Am jet, we are shunted off to the "VIP" room, so 
named because it has a coffee pot and seascape paintings that 
look pilfered from a south Florida retirement village. Here, we 
are given our media "indoctrination" packages, never an 
encouraging word if you aspire to reportorial autonomy. As we 
sit watching CNN, an unfounded rumor gains currency. Though it's 
Saturday, and we're supposed to be in Cuba until Monday, the 
military has changed plans and is going to make us leave 
Guantanamo Sunday morning. "One thing's for sure," says a wire 
reporter, "you won't have to sort through all your notes to 
decide what to lead with."

  Fearing an abbreviated schedule, I commence valuable 
newsgathering. Knowing that in some Taliban-held provinces, 
pederasty rivaled headless-goat polo (buzkashi) as the favorite 
pastime, I ask a Naval officer if there are any reports of 
Guantanamo prisoners turning to man-love. "Oh God no," he says. 
"Though there are some Air Force personnel over there, so who 
knows what's going on?"

  Another officer relays something we'll hear repeated often: that 
because of international political pressure, the prisoners are 
getting coddled. The latest report has Army guards directing 
detainees on which way to pray to Mecca. "They're actually going 
to paint arrows on the floors of the cells so they'll know to 
face north," he says. "You mean east," I say. "North, east, 
whatever," he replies, "I'm Lutheran--I don't know where the 
hell it is."

  A FEW hours later, we touch down at the Guantanamo landing strip 
on the isolated leeward side of the base (Gitmo, as it is 
nicknamed, is actually bisected by Guantanamo Bay). After 
getting sniffed by a German shepherd who's more interested in 
bombs than my colleague's Percocet, we're escorted to the media 
center, an ugly wood-paneled affair that sits next to a pink 
hangar. After another hour or two of waiting, a mouthy reporter 
loudly calls his editor so we can all hear him report the 
latest: "Same shit, different day. Though they're really 
cleaning up the media center. Curtains, an air conditioner, even 
a freakin' bulletin board!"

  The hospitality ends there. A stern sign on the bulletin board 
admonishes us to clean up after ourselves. The goodies set out 
on a table (grape beverage powder and apple jelly from 
meals-ready-to-eat packs) practically scream, "Can't wait till 
you leave." Many of us had secretly harbored the fantasy that we 
could talk our overseers into letting us go right up to the 
prisoners' cells, the terrorist equivalent of a field trip to 
the ASPCA.

  But as a gaggle of public affairs officers enter, they lay down 
two immutable laws: There will be no access to detainees (the 
Geneva Convention forbids making them a "public curiosity"). And 
we can go only where the officers take us. Running the public 
affairs show is Army Lt. Col. William Costello, a bearish 
soldier who looks like the kind of guy who enjoys breaking 
things on his face. His hard, dark orbs dart to and fro while he 
delivers a good news/bad news proposition. The good news is 
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld will be visiting the 
detainees' Camp X-Ray the next morning. The bad news is that the 
unfounded rumor is founded--the Pentagon press corps is coming 
with him, and we'll be forced to leave a day early.

  Immediately, an angry media throng closes in on Costello, the 
air now containing an Altamont-like level of violence. "My 
editors are going to crush my nuts," says one reporter, probably 
female. "This is crazy," I say, "How am I supposed to get enough 
material for a piece?" "Not my problem," replies Costello. "This 
is bullshit," thunders another print reporter. "You're making us 
leave as the biggest story gets here." "You're not allowed to 
stay," says Costello. "Why not?" snaps the reporter. Costello's 
blood rises as his high-and-tight haircut stands up like an 
angry-dog scruff: "BECAUSE ... YOU'RE ... NOT ... STAYING!" 
"Welcome to the Pearl of the Antilles," deadpans Lt. Commander 
Brendan McPherson, in a limp cruise-director chirp.

  It's understandable if public affairs types are a little testy. 
There's an obvious culture clash (military personnel don't get 
paid to ask why; journalists don't get paid otherwise). Besides 
that, ever since the detainees started arriving on January 11, 
Gitmo and the joint forces being run under Southern Command have 
experienced the PR equivalent of what my ever-subtle 
colleagues--borrowing from Special Forces terminology for 
disastrous missions--call a "goat f--." In the richest irony of 
the war on terrorism, the Department of Defense, which normally 
goes out of its way not to make news, caused an international 
outcry by releasing still shots of detainees being brought to 
Camp X-Ray.

  As they were transported and in-processed, al Qaeda members were 
photographed kneeling, wearing earmuffs, shackles, and blackout 
goggles. Though these seemed perfectly reasonable precautions to 
take when transporting by C-141 members of an organization 
already responsible for one prison uprising (Mazar-i-Sharif, 
which resulted in a CIA operative's death) and several suicide 
plane crashes, human rights groups and international media, led 
by a chorus of Euro-whiners, immediately lapsed into hysterics.

  The British press, with typical understatement, claimed 
prisoners were being "brutalized, tortured, and humiliated," and 
that the whole operation was nothing more than "a sick attempt 
to appeal to the worst red-neck prejudices." Tony Blair pointed 
out that the three British al Qaeda members being held at Gitmo 
have had no complaints. But that didn't stop the Mirror's 
Stephen Moyes from method reporting by donning an al Qaeda rig. 
"Wrapped in the suffocating orange boiler suit," he wrote, "I 
lost any sense of dignity"--a loss he could have just as easily 
sustained by rereading his own copy.

  Sillier still were protestations from such humanitarians as 
Saddam Hussein and the government of Malaysia (Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad has made some of the loudest noise, though 
Amnesty International dings him for arresting the speechwriter 
of a political rival, who was then blindfolded, stripped naked, 
punched, verbally abused, and forced to simulate homosexual 
acts--none of which is alleged at Camp X-Ray). About the only 
foreign leader who has supported the American detainee camp, 
ironically, is Fidel Castro, who is either angling to end the 
embargo or inching ever closer to dementia. (He declared January 
"Americans' Month" and invited Jimmy Carter for a visit.)

  All of this has made Camp X-Ray personnel a sensitive lot. On 
the ferry crossing over to the windward side where the camp is 
located, I sit next to a now mellow Lt. Col. Costello, who has 
decided to patch things up with the reporter he snapped at, and 
who, after getting the sign-off from Southern Command, has 
cleared us to stay through Rumsfeld's visit. Costello, like many 
Gitmo types, is baffled at the uproar over the prisoners' 
treatment. "Soldiers and Marines that are guarding the detainees 
at Camp X-Ray have worse conditions than the detainees," he 
says. Much has been made over their being kept in outdoor cells, 
invariably called "cages," which are topped with corrugated 
tin-covered wooden roofs that keep what little rain Gitmo gets 
(six inches a year) off the prisoners. Costello says their 
eight-by-eight cells contain about twice as much space as 
soldiers have in their crowded, unventilated tents a few hundred 
yards away.

  "They're getting warm showers, clean laundry, hot chow," 
Costello says of the prisoners. "They're getting 2,600 calories 
a day. I'm not getting 2,600 calories a day. I'm running my ass 
off chasing you guys around." (One of the medics treating 
detainees claims that a full quarter of them were suffering from 
malnutrition when they were captured.)

  But we don't have to take Costello's word for it. We can see for 
ourselves, sort of. After a quick stop at McDonald's (the only 
one in Cuba), our white school bus transports us past beautiful 
seaside vistas and brownish cactus-infested scrub, past 
ramshackle housing and up a hill, which features an abandoned 
auto yard that the locals used to call Sears. It's where they'd 
strip old junkers for parts then used on jerry-rigged jalopies 
called "Gitmo specials."

  Across from Sears is Camp X-Ray, a teeming hive of concertina 
wire, canvas tents, guard towers, and newly constructed plywood 
interrogation shacks with window-unit air conditioners. The 
chain-link cells themselves don't need air conditioning, since a 
comfortable Caribbean breeze (temperatures range from the low 
70s at night to the low 80s during the day) continuously 
circulates through the encampment.

  Restricted to an area about 150 yards away from the open-air 
cellblocks, we observe the camp from a slight elevation that 
CNN's John Zarrella calls "Heartbreak Ridge," so named "because 
if you're a journalist, it breaks your heart that you can't get 
closer." Gitmo has actually been the site of a lot of heartbreak 
over the years.

  It broke Christopher Columbus's, when he stopped here on his 
second New World voyage. He left after failing to find gold, 
threatening to cut off the tongues of his crew if they didn't 
agree to pretend they'd reached Asia. It also rankles Castro, 
who has wanted to throw us off the island for four decades, but 
can't because of a pre-Revolution lease agreement. Likewise, 
when thousands of Cuban rafters were detained here for months in 
the mid-'90s, many grew so unhappy with Gitmo's ghostly 
desolation that they'd do anything to leave, including inject 
diesel fuel into their veins, drive tent stakes into their 
limbs, even swim back to Castro's Cuba.

  By comparison, the al Qaedans look pretty fat, if not happy. 
They laze away in the shade of their cells. They sleep on 
inch-and-a-half-thick isomats, the same ones that are issued to 
our military. With the assistance of a Muslim Navy chaplain, 
they pray five times daily. (Quick studies, the al Qaedans 
didn't need arrows painted on their cell floors. A single 
signpost next to an American flag points the way to Mecca.) And 
while American prisoners in the Hanoi Hilton often spent years 
in solitary confinement and received no medical care (John 
McCain to this day can't comb his own hair), X-Ray detainees get 
daily sick calls from all manner of doctors, from optometrists 
to podiatrists. The prisoners (who represent about 25 different 
nationalities but mostly are Saudis) can also freely chat with 
each other about God knows what: prison uprisings, the demise of 
Talk magazine, trades of Froot Loops for garlic bagel chips.

  Their restroom arrangements are pretty spartan. They get a white 
bucket for emergency squirts, while they are instructed to hold 
two fingers up for the alternative. At that time, a guard 
shackles them and takes them to the port-o-loo. While the 
military has spared no expense in construction costs (in three 
weeks, they built a completely operational field hospital 
staffed by 160 medical personnel--two more than there are 
prisoners), they've saved a fortune in toilet paper. It's the 
detainees' cultural preference not to use any. "We don't shake 
their hands," says one camp guard.

  In addition to the aforementioned amenities, detainees also 
receive two towels, a Koran, a shortened toothbrush (still long 
enough to file into a shiv), a canteen, a bucket of water, 
fluoride toothpaste, and shampoo. Not just any shampoo, but 
"Lively" salon anti-dandruff shampoo--a "luxurious shampoo in a 
gentle formula that restores moisture, shine, and body to your 
beautifully clean hair." Those who think the prisoners are 
getting coddled (Rep. John Mica, a Florida Republican, visited 
the camp and said it's "too good for the bastards") will be 
happy to know that the shampoo is not jojoba-enriched.

  WHILE public affairs officers these days are going to great 
lengths to talk about how docile the prisoners are, detainees 
have been reported biting a guard, spitting, and threatening to 
kill Americans. When I skirt away from my minders and visit the 
Marine snipers' tent, I learn it went well beyond that.

  The snipers, of course, are the camp's deadliest sharpshooters, 
ropy young bucks (21-23 years of age) who seem largely culled 
from the western or southern United States, where firearms are 
often regarded as extra appendages. Their tent looks like a 
Marines-issued college dorm room: Skoal-juice bottles, laundry 
hanging everywhere, and a spade-like sniper insignia banner 
tacked to a tent wall. If there is a prison uprising, it is 
these gentleman who will man the guard towers and introduce the 
rioters to their 72 black-eyed virgins.

  At some point, that might become necessary, they tell me, as 
plotting is obviously afoot. Sgt. Matt Lampert of Montana says 
the other day one of the prisoners was caught "with a piece of 
cloth stuffed with rocks that was tied off at the end." Sgt. 
Rodney Davis says that during chowtime, he sees them through his 
scope "making terrain models out of their food." And unlike say, 
Afghan prisons, where starving detainees are reportedly begging 
to be sent to Gitmo, there's plenty of food to play with. "They 
get fed better than us, sir," says Lampert. When I ask the 
Marines if they've seen anything weird, they laugh sheepishly, 
looking at each other. Finally, Sgt. Josh Westbrook, who sports 
a forearm tattoo of flaming baby heads, steps up. "They know 
they're being watched," he explains, "so they'll stare at you, 
and while they stare at you, they'll, uh, masturbate."

  According to these Marines, they don't just pleasure themselves 
to freak out the snipers, but also to embarrass the female Army 
guards in the camp's interior. The weirdness doesn't end there. 
They've also eaten their toiletries and urinated on equipment. 
"The other day," says Westbrook, "one of the guys tried to do a 
naked cartwheel." In the most bizarre twist, Lance Corporal 
Devin Klebaur says a few have also been known to "put toothpaste 
in their ass." "What's the purpose?" I ask. "I'm not sure," he 
says, puzzled.

  After leaving the snipers, I collar other grunts who say they 
believe the prisoners are more apt to act out whenever they see 
one of the regular visitors from the International Committee of 
the Red Cross enter the camp. "They're looking to be 
disciplined," says one, so that any aggressive guard behavior 
will make it look as if they're being brutalized by the American 
military in front of international witnesses. ICRC visits, says 
another soldier, are the highlight of a prisoner's day, since 
they've been spotted "giving the unshackled prisoners cookies 
and milk, cigarettes, shaking their hands." Many organizations 
who haven't been to Gitmo, like Human Rights Watch, have been 
extremely critical of the prisoners' treatment, while the ICRC 
has aired no complaints. Still, says another soldier, "They're a 
pain in the ass. We see them offering them cookies, hugging them 
like they're best buddies. They're undermining everything we're 
trying to do."

  What we're trying to do isn't exactly clear at this point. We 
are certainly interrogating the prisoners, though base sources 
won't divulge any information that's been gleaned. The prisoners 
will likely be formally charged and tried, though when I called 
a senior Pentagon source to find out by whom and when, the 
source said, "If you find out, will you please tell me?"

  ON SUNDAY, Rumsfeld visits, and we hope for illumination. 
Sitting on a bus on the tarmac, waiting for the secretary to 
emerge from his plane, we pass the time as journalists do, 
discussing the AP-style spelling of "bin Laden," speculating 
whether the prisoners will get an Internet cafe (one of them has 
asked for video games), and making fun of the fresh-meat 
Pentagon press corps, who are overdressed in heavy wools instead 
of our much cooler island linens.

  One of Rumsfeld's security agents mounts our bus, telling us the 
ground rules: no photos on the tarmac, no fighting, no hitting 
Rumsfeld in the head with a boom mike. After Rumsfeld tours Camp 
X-Ray with four senators and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, Richard Myers (who is so overshadowed by the secretary's 
rock star aura that one reporter has to ask who he is), Rumsfeld 
meets the press on Heartbreak Ridge. He gives the sort of hooah 
performance that has endeared him to both the troops and the 
press. While he remains as firm as ever that the detainees are 
"illegal combatants," not "prisoners of war," which would afford 
them more rights under the Geneva Convention, he nicely avoids 
plucking the only hair worth splitting--whether the captives' 
status is his call. (Human rights hawks say the matter should be 
decided by a "competent tribunal," whatever that is.)

  Even if it isn't up to Rumsfeld, the argument seems rather 
academic. It's hard to imagine anyone who has actually read the 
Geneva Convention wanting to confer POW status on alleged al 
Qaeda members. Doing so would not only make the terrorists 
eligible for repatriation to their home countries, but also 
would forbid their being punished for trying to escape, allow 
them to receive "scientific equipment" from home, and even 
confer upon them the right to dentures--in case they lost their 
teeth while, say, biting a guard. Most ludicrous, they would be 
afforded "advances of pay" in an amount "never ... inferior" to 
that which we pay our own armed forces. If you're a terrorist 
from Central Asia, it's not a bad deal: Kill Americans, get 
arrested, then get a pay raise from America.

  With all the global bellyaching about the detainees' right to 
humane treatment, it's hard to imagine them getting better 
treatment than they're already receiving. On my last day at 
Gitmo, all I have time to eat is a stale Ding Dong and a greasy 
plate of onion rings. My public affairs keepers couldn't care 
less. By contrast, for breakfast and lunch alone, the prisoners 
are served oatmeal, an orange, peanut butter, margarine, a 
"culturally appropriate" halal meal, and a giant snack pack 
containing Froot Loops, raisins, a Nature Valley granola bar, 
baked garlic bagel chips, and Bullseye barbecue-seasoned 
sunflower kernels. Still, the overseers of the prison are 
concerned that detainees aren't getting enough pita bread with 
their meals, and they're planning to make the food spicier, just 
the way the prisoners like it back home.

  While we wait, we journalists have to stand in the hot sun most 
of the day. After hours, we are confined to our Consolidated 
Bachelor Quarters, sleeping four to a duplex room on cots, some 
without pillows or blankets. We aren't even allowed to go the 
beach, a few hundred yards away from our building (though, 
emboldened by the rum we imported from Puerto Rico, a colleague 
and I make a mad dash under a guard searchlight for the 
bathwater Caribbean anyway). Besides drinking, our only 
entertainment is a pool table--one cue is cracked, the other is 
missing its tip. The prisoners, by contrast, get to read their 
Korans, while novels and more "religious books" are on the way.

  At the end of their day, they get a good night's sleep in a 
single cell. At the end of our day, we are told that a C-141 
(the same plane that transported the detainees) just became 
available, and we are prematurely hustled off so the military 
can dump us in Nowheresville, New Jersey, on a Sunday night 
after every rental car place in the state has closed.

  Perhaps the international community is right. The treatment 
being meted out at Guantanamo is inhumane. To see for yourself, 
don't bother canvassing Camp X-Ray prisoners. Just get a Gitmo 
press pass.

   Tokyo irked by US stance on Kyoto

 



  TOKYO - Coral reefs will die from water that's too hot. Polar 
bears will have less room to roam, crowding some of them out of 
existence. Birds will start flying an extra mile north each 
year, and may starve when they get there.

  These are among the dire possible consequences of global 
warming, say climate-change experts. At no time was it clearer 
that countries should take steps to slow this process than when 
150 countries signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997.

  But now, with President George Bush saying the US will not 
ratify the protocol - which was shaped in part to fit 
Washington's concerns five years ago - the accord's ultimate 
effectiveness is in doubt, and many US allies are irritated.

  For Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, the shaping of the accord 
on their soil was a source of pride - and proof that they were 
still relevant players on the world stage.

  "It is absolutely inadmissible for the US, which is the greatest 
gas-emitting country, to once again turn its back and present 
something that is against Kyoto Protocol and the framework 
convention on climate change," says Mie Asaoka, president of the 
Kiko Network, a Tokyo environmental-umbrella organization 
representing about 150 Japanese groups.

  The clash over how to stop global warming while allowing 
sluggish economies to prosper occurs at an awkward point in 
US-Japanese relations. US analysts looking east say that as 
Japan's economic dominance in Asia diminishes, so will the 
importance of the US-Japan relationship as a whole.

  The US Department of Defense recently left Japan off its list of 
nations contributing to the post-Sept. 11 war on terror. 
Realizing the accidental slight, the US later apologized for 
overlooking Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's efforts - 
considered tremendously ambitious here - to alter the 
interpretation of Japan's post-World War II pacifist 
constitution in order to dispatch warships for noncombat 
support.

  During Mr. Bush's visit here last month, Mr. Koizumi gently 
balked at the president's proposed alternative to the Kyoto 
agreement, saying that Japan would "like to see further efforts" 
on the part of the US.

  While there are no protesters in the streets, there is an air of 
indignation here over Washington's "do-it-our-way" decision on 
something that effects the whole globe.

  Among the Kiko Network's handouts is a pamphlet with a cartoon 
of the world. On one end, Koizumi defensively holds up the Kyoto 
Protocol. On the other, a fiendish-looking Bush seizes a weeping 
globe in his monster-size hands.

  In the eyes of Japan and many US allies, the Bush 
administration's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol is 
one of many signals that Washington is growing increasingly 
unilateralist in the six months since the Sept. 11 attacks on 
America. From pulling out of Kyoto - which is in the process of 
being ratified by the European Union - to labeling Iran, Iraq, 
and North Korea an "axis of evil" and prime targets in the next 
phase of the war, America's allies are seeing in the US a 
growing tendency to act first and consult later.

  The Bush administration is offering its own alternative plan, 
the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, which 
aides say are more market-sensitive and will reduce the worst 
air pollutants by 70 percent while finding a strategy to cut 
greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent over the next 10 years.

  But environmental advocates say Bush's alternative will allow 
the US to continue to increase the amount of gas it emits. They 
fear that, because the US is forging its own way, smaller 
nations that are expected to ratify the Kyoto Protocol could 
start backing out. This could lead to a two-tier system in which 
the US and a few others - Australia and Canada may follow suit - 
will choose their own targets, while the rest of the world will 
be limited to the stricter Kyoto limits.

  
Not everyone in Japan is upset with Bush's alternative.

  Japanese industry has already gone through vigorous 
energy-saving - and thus environmentally friendly - drives after 
the two energy crises of the 1970s and 1980s, says Mitsuru 
Shinozaki, a spokesman for Keidanren, the country's most 
influential business lobby. After the Earth Summit of 10 years 
ago, he says, Japan discussed and implemented a self-action plan 
to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. "Any further policy to 
reduce emissions," he says "will hurt Japanese industrial 
competitiveness."

 Kitakyushu, Japan, Feb. 12 Kyodo -- A 3,986-ton Panamanian cargo ship heading to Taiwan from South Korea sank in the East China Sea late Monday, leaving one sailor dead and another of the 20-member crew missing, the Japan Coast Guard said Tuesday. 
	
	
 Coast Guard officials said the vessel, Triumph Kaohsiung, sank at around 11:30 p.m. at a point about 110 kilometers west of Goto islands in western Nagasaki Prefecture. 
	
	
 Officials said 19 crew members were plucked up from the sea and one died later. 
	
	
 According to the Triumph Kaohsiung crew, the vessel was flooded with water and the engine stopped at around 7 p.m. Monday, and the ship sank four and a half hours later. 
	
	
 The ship was heading to the southern Taiwan city Kaohsiung with a cargo of steel products that was loaded in the South Korean port Pohang. 
	
	
 Coast Guard officials said Japanese coast guard vessels plucked 12 survivors from a lifeboat and seven others from the sea. One of the rescued sailors died later. 
	
	
 Japanese coast guard aircraft and patrol boats were in the area looking for the missing sailor. 
	
	
 The ship's crew consisted of 11 Chinese, one Taiwanese, two Indonesians and six Myanmarese.	


	
Following the end of the Cold War, the United States has become the world's sole superpower and the trend of pragmatism in its foreign policy has become clearer and clearer. Pragmatism is, in the first place, the United States' traditional policy. After coming to power, unilateralism and pragmatism have become Bush's main foreign policy line. Alternate use of and complementary nature of pragmatism and unilateralism constitute the characteristics of the Bush administration's diplomacy. 
	
	
 Once coming to power, Bush insisted on deploying the National Missile Defense System [NMD]. The international community and even US western allies, including US neighbor Canada, have consistently opposed the plan. Despite the opposition, Bush went it alone. One of the main US diplomatic goals for this year is to persuade the international community to accept the NMD and Russia to agree to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty [AMD] by flashing a carrot on a stick. At one time, he said the new US missile defense system would not pose a threat to the international security and would not trigger an arms race; on another occasion, he stated the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1972 was "a product of the Cold War era," and thus has lost its binding force. He even claimed that to develop the NMD, the United States would be even prepared to scrap the ABM. Over the past year, Bush increased funds for research and testing for the N!
MD and accelerated the test frequency of the anti-missile system. Even after the adoption of the resolution on "maintaining and abiding by the "Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty" on 29 November at the 56th United Nations General Assembly, the United States still persisted in carrying out a fifth missile interception test. In a word, the US development of the NMD is for the purpose of "attacking other countries and at the same time preventing other countries from attacking it," thereby genuinely securing its status of being the "sole super power." 
	
	
 The Sino-US plane collision event that occurred on 1 April can best illustrate the US alternate application of the "two-isms" in its diplomacy. In the plane collision event, if one goes by the US logic, only the US spy plane is permitted to spy at other people's doorsteps; the host, on the other hand, does not even have the right to look after its doors and to protect its yard. The responsibility for the event, in which a Chinese plane crashed and a Chinese pilot perished, lies completely with the US side. The US side not only refused to apologize to China but also claimed that "US crew members were detained by the Chinese side." It was only because of it being deterred by the Chinese Government's firm position and due to the fact that the US crew members were still in China that the United States was compelled to offer an apology. But after the Chinese side released all the US crew members, major US political figures changed their stance immediately and threatened to use human rights, trade, and Olympics hosting issues to "retaliate" against China. 
	
	
 Since coming to power, Bush, proceeding from the US immediate interests, has also adopted the pragmatism and unilateralism position with regard to international treaties. This March, catering to the interests of the US oil and coal barons who have made large political donations to the Republican Party, Bush announced, without prior consultations with its allies, that the United States would not enforce the "Kyoto Protocol" which is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the world. This announcement was met with unanimous condemnation by the international media. 
	
	
 In July, the Bush administration decided to let the "Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty" "freeze" in the Senate. Hard on the heels of that decision, the US negotiation representative Marie Chevrier announced in Geneva that the Bush administration would not support the implementation of the "Biological Weapons Convention" and that the United States strongly objected to the concrete enforcement plan of this convention. 
	
	
 The Bush administration either refuses to sign, ratify, or implement international treaties or asks for their revision. It only wants the international treaties that benefit the US security and economy and globalization. It does not want anything to do with the international treaties, mechanisms, and organizations that restrict or prevent US freedom. It does not want anything to do with countries and organizations that do not follow its orders or that always cause troubles to it. 
	
	
 After the 11 September attacks on the United States, the international community strongly condemned the terrorist acts and expressed sympathy and support to the American people. Supported by the world, the United States launched the "war against terrorism" of this century. Bush stressed that the war is not only the "US war" but also a "world war." The United States views itself as a "major force of anti-terrorism," for in the world only the United States has the capability to carry out the global war against terrorism. Bush said, "Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists" and "any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime." The United States wants all the countries in the world to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and decides which country is its enemy or friend on the basis of that country's attitude toward it. It is in fact like using multilateral diplomacy to enhance US unilateralism. But the United States obviously practices pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan -- a frontline state in the fight against Pakistan. Before the 11 September event, the United States kept its distance from Pakistan and imposed sanctions on it. But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it. Whether the United States will continue to treat Pakistan in a responsible manner, it is anybody's guess.

Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Liberal Party) has voiced his approval of the U.S. treatment of the 144 al-Qaida prisoners at the U.S. Guantanamo military base on Cuba. 
	
	
 "The U.S. Government has announced that the United States will respect its international commitments," Fogh Rasmussen said at his weekly press conference on Tuesday [22 January]. 
	
	
 He points out that the United States has allowed the Red Cross to inspect conditions at the Guantanamo base. 
	
	
 Criticism From the Red Cross 
	
	
 He fails to mention, however, that on the international stage the Red Cross has subsequently criticized the U.S. treatment of prisoners. 
	
	
 EU foreign affairs spokesman Javier Solana, among others, has also criticized the United States for not recognizing the al-Qaida prisoners as prisoners of war as understood in the Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 The Swedish Government has also expressed concern about the prisoners' rights. 
	
	
 Fogh: They Must Be Given a Fair Trial 
	
	
 "The prisoners must be treated with respect for their integrity and religion, and they must be given a fair trial," Fogh Rasmussen says. 
	
	
 On Monday Liberal Party foreign affairs spokesman Troels Lund Poulsen said that the debate on prisoners' rights is "an intellectual discussion." 
	
	
 Per Stig Moller: Give Them Rights 
	
	
 Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller (Conservative People's Party) is urging the United States to guarantee the prisoners the status of prisoners of war and in consequence protection under the terms of the Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 "I expect the United States to satisfy the requirements of the international conventions," Per Stig Moller said at a press conference in Berlin on Monday. 
	
	
 " Social Democratic Party: Raise Denmark's Voice 
	
	
 The Social Democratic Party takes the view that the Danish Government should raise its voice against the United States. 
	
	
 "I do not have all the information, but there are some questionable aspects in the U.S. approach," political spokesman Mogens Lykketoft (Social Democratic Party) told Ritzau Bureau. 
	
	
 "Of course the United States has a point when it says that it can be difficult to decide who are terrorists and who are prisoners of war. We must focus on the treatment of them." 
	
	
 The Socialist People's Party is sending an "urgent call" to the government to deliver official criticism to the United States. 
	
	
 "It cannot be the duty of the Danish Government to applaud everything that the Americans do. Even though we support their action, we should criticize this form of treatment of prisoners," Socialist People's Party Chairman Holger K. Nielsen said. 
	
	
 He will now ask the foreign minister to give a written reply outlining the government's position on the issue. 
	
	
 Danish People's Party: Are They Danes? 
	
	
 The Danish People's Party sees no reason to criticize the United States. 
	
	
 "To begin with, I have great confidence that what the Americans are doing in relation to these prisoners is reasonable. I can imagine that the United States has had good reasons for transporting them to Cuba," foreign affairs spokesman Peter Skaarup (Danish People's Party) says. 
	
	
 As long as no Danes are involved, the Danish People's Party does not think that Denmark should interfere. 
	
	
 "This could of course become necessary if a Dane were involved. Otherwise it must be a matter between the United States and the countries which have citizens who are directly affected," Peter Skaarup said, alluding to the United Kingdom and Sweden. 
	
	
	


	
Spanish daily urges caution in judging USA's treatment of suspects 
	
	
 Text of unsigned editorial, "Treatment of the prisoners", by Spanish newspaper ABC web site on 22|January 
	
	
 The dissemination of some photos taken of a group of detainees in Guantanamo has aroused international controversy. Critics condemn the inhumane nature of the treatment the prisoners are receiving, handcuffed, immobilized with shackles, subjected to sensory deprivation and confined to minute cells. If these accusations are confirmed, the only possible definition will be torture and the violation of human rights. However, we may be witnessing a distortion of reality, and even in some cases pure falsehoods. The photos were sent voluntarily to the press by the American authorities, who clarified that they depicted a group of 20 dangerous prisoners who had recently arrived at the base and undergone a process of identification prior to their confinement. These were in no way their normal living conditions. But the decisive fact is the presence for days of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is preparing a report and which, as usual, has refused to make any statements. It will speak in its report. Herein lies the difference. In the countries in which torture is systematically carried out, for example Cuba or China, inspection by international organizations is not permitted. The result of the report will have to be taken into account before political and moral judgments of guilty or not guilty are made. For the time being, the members of the British government who interviewed three prisoners of their nationality have received no complaints about the treatment they are receiving. Indications exist that the system to which the prisoners are subjected is excessively harsh. The United States government does not help dispel the suspicions when it refuses to consider them prisoners of war and therefore to apply the Geneva Convention to them. Nor does it seem proper to cite the fact that the base is not on American soil because it is a rented base. Backing from a majority of the public would not serve, either, as justification for the possible excesses and violations of rights. But for the time being, what exist are indications and shadows of suspicion which must materialize or be dispelled through knowledge of the facts from the relevant reports. It is another matter to launch into scandal or anti-Americanism. In any case, the attitude of the American authorities has nothing to do with the one previously and currently displayed by dictatorships and totalitarian systems, including communist ones, which permit neither inspection nor the dissemination of photographs. But this enormous difference is not enough. It must be known as soon as possible whether or not terror has been established in Guantanamo. 
	
	
	


	
For its own reasons, which are linked to its interests and, naturally, to Israel's interests, the United States chose to put intensive pressure on the Palestinian Authority. It wanted the PA to meet difficult, even impossible, security conditions. It also tried, through this pressure, to remove the legitimacy of the PA and its chairman Yasir Arafat under the pretext of terrorism or support for terrorism. This US position, which is fully biased to Israel, strengthened Israeli Prime Minister Ari'el Sharon's attempts to suppress national Palestinian ambitions and achieve his declared objective of establishing Israeli security on the rubble of the legitimate Palestinian rights. 
	
	
 It would have perhaps been logical and acceptable if Washington had demanded a mutual and concurrent cessation of the ongoing violence between the Palestinians and the Israelis and called on Israel not to exploit the calm to open the files of security revenge through assassinations and arrests. It would have been logical and acceptable if Washington had asked Israel to announce its commitment to the principle of withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967 and to end the settlement activity. Such demands constitute the strong base for bringing about calm and stability, putting a final end to violence and terrorism, and turning a new leaf toward fruitful negotiations leading to a just peace acceptable by all sides. 
	
	
 The situation and its tragic repercussions are being viewed only from the Israeli perspective. The killing of hundreds of Palestinians and the increase in the number of martyrs among children are being ignored. And the destruction of homes, installations, and PA infrastructure is being overlooked. This does not serve the interest of peace and the security of the peoples of the region in the long run. On the contrary, it heightens the sense of frustration among all sectors of the Palestinian people and damages the credibility of the United States as a sponsor of the peace process, indeed as an effective partner in the settlement negotiations from the start of the peace process in the late eighties until this process faltered as a result of Israel's intransigence after Sharon came to power. 
	
	
 The United States realizes that the Palestinians are serious in their efforts to achieve a just peace. The Palestinians left no avenue unexplored in their quest for a settlement that enables them to regain their legitimate rights and provides all the peoples of the region, including the Israelis, with security and stability. It is, therefore, unfair to blame the PA for the tension, and sometimes violence, that takes place as a result of the Israeli oppressive measures and activities. Every oppressive or vindictive Israeli action has a Palestinian reaction that cannot be stopped. Before 1994, Israel was in control of all the occupied Palestinian territories and yet it was unable, despite all its forces, weapons, and measures, to achieve full and comprehensive quiet in the West Bank and Gaza throughout 27 years. 
	
	
 In this context, we must note the role of all Arab and international forces in curbing Israeli military operations against Palestinian cities and residential areas and in explaining the true picture of the situation to the United States. Certainly, the intensive efforts that our big sister, Egypt, made to bridle the Israeli oppressive activity and to warn the Israeli prime minister against targeting President Arafat and the PA are highly appreciated by the Palestinian people in particular and the Arab nation in general. 
	
	
	


	
Islamabad, March 18, IRNA - Central Leader of Pakistan People Party (PPP) and former provincial minister of North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected US state department report on Human Rights in Iran and other countries, saying America has no right to make such a report as it is itself the violator of human rights. He told IRNA in an interview on Monday, "America has killed thousands of innocent people in almost all parts of the globe particularly in the Muslim world. America, in the guise of its so-called war on terror, has killed and injured thousands of innocent Afghans and the prisoners of war are maltreated." A couple of weeks ago, the US state department in its annual report had revealed that Iran, Pakistan and some other countries are the violators of human rights. "America has a double standard policy. It denounces human rights violation but supports Israel for perishing the Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon," Abbas criticized. He said those countries and nations which are independant in real sense of the world and do not take dictation from the US or accepts its supremacy are labelled as human rights violators. "Those who submit to its policies are showered upon favours," he added. "America always follows its interests. In its so-called war against terrorism and against weapons of mass destruction lies its covert motive and that is its strategic and economic interests," Abbas added. However, he hoped that the people of the world can no more be kept in dark. "They can see and observe the unjust and discriminatory policies of America. People do not believe whatever the America says," he concluded.	


	
France's Chirac says Argentina must make necessary choices 
	
	
 Text of report by French news agency AFP 
	
	
 Paris, 2 January: During a telephone conversation on Wednesday [2 January] with the director general of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Horst Koehler, President Jacques Chirac stressed the need for Argentina to be able to "make the choices" imposed on it by the crisis it is going through. Reporting on the conversation, Elysee [presidency] spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that the head of state had "expressed the hope that the Argentine authorities will know how to make the choices needed for their country's future". "France, like its partners, is in contact with international financial institutions," the president said, "and is ready to support the action of the IMF with a view to attaining a solution to this crisis." Jacques Chirac, Mrs Colonna said, also raised with the IMF director general "the situation of a number of other countries, among them Lebanon in connection with the consolidation of economic reforms in this country, with which France has special ties"!

Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens has admitted that it is unfeasible to guarantee the flow of revenues to the government if the Finance Secretariat maintains its estimate that the crude export platform in 2002 will average 1.825 million barrels per day, at a price of $17.00 per barrel. 
	
	
 "One would have to talk in depth with the Finance Secretariat's people to hear the criteria that they used to establish that benchmark," he claimed, declining to give details on the manner in which the federal government's secretariats establish the price of crude in the General Criteria for Economic Policy. 
	
	
 In fact, Martens admitted that this volume of crude exports has not been achieved this year. According to Pemex [Mexican Petroleum] figures, between January and September the daily exports of barrels of oil did not exceed an average of 1.71 million. During September alone, this average dropped to 1.64 million. 
	
	
 In the General Preliminary Criteria for Economic Policy 2002, the final text of which is being presented to Congress by the government today, the Finance Secretariat estimated an average price of $17.00 per barrel for the crude mixture, and predicted that the export platform would be 1.825 million barrels per day. 
	
	
 The volume appears large in the current economic context, when oil prices have fallen back to 1999 levels. Hence, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), will decide at its meeting on Wednesday whether or not to cut its worldwide crude production in an effort to shore up energy prices. 
	
	
 Traditionally, Mexico has supported the OPEC cutbacks; however, analysts agreed that it will now tend to support the United States, the main world consumer, and the one that would be adversely affected by a possible increase in crude prices. 
	
	
 George Baker, director of Mexico Energy Intelligence, expressed this opinion: "In the event that the Mexican Government gives priority to its relationship with the United States, it will not be a game without risks. And it is possible that, at some given time, OPEC may hand it the bill for not collaborating in the reduction of the oil supply." 
	
	
 He noted that the Mexican economy is very closely linked to that of the United States, and hence no oil producer, whether a member of OPEC or not, is in such a disadvantageous situation. 
	
	
 Frederic Lasserre, an energy sector analyst for the firm Societe Generale, held the view that Mexico's close relationship with the United States prevents it from becoming more committed to OPEC. 
	
	
 "The US authorities would not like to have it (Mexico) as a trading partner and, at the same time, close to OPEC," he observed. 
	
	
 With regard to prices, he gave a reminder that the reason that prompted Mexico to collaborate with OPEC in 1998 was, in fact, the decline in them. 
	
	
 But Ken Miller, from the firm Purvin &amp;amp; Gertz, included an additional factor. 
	
	
 "Mexico sought out the leading producers: Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, not only for the prices, but also because of the competition on the crude oil market (in US territory)," he claimed, pointing out that prices have not yet fallen as low as they did then. 
	
	
 In 1998, the Mexican oil mixture averaged $10.17 per barrel: now, the lowest levels have reached $14.00 per barrel. 
	
	
 Miller remarked that the worldwide economic slowdown has shrunk the demand for energy sources, which could lead the independent producers, including Mexico, to operate in coordination with the oil cartel. 
	
	
 Nevertheless, according to the researcher from the UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico] Economics Department, Angel de la Vega, since the Fox administration does not have the security of a fiscal reform available, it cannot be ruled out that Mexico might collaborate with OPEC in the event of a more serious reduction in oil prices. 
	
	
 Miguel Garcia Reyes, a specialist in petroleum geopolitics at the College of Mexico, claimed that Mexico's distancing from OPEC has become more intensified since the attacks on the United States. 
	
	
 He emphasized: "Now Mexico is positioned between two fronts: it recognizes the need for reducing the supply on the market, but the policy is to support the United States and supply it with more crude if it should become necessary." 
	
	
 In terms of market, the Mexican exports do not play an important role, but the support for OPEC on the part of Mexico, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia in 1998 and 1999 lent credibility to the policy of cutbacks, and achieved the recovery of prices. 
	
	
 Promises Are Cheap 
	
	
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has agreed on three cuts in its production thus far this year, for the purpose of preventing the crude prices from becoming weaker. Nevertheless, it has not kept its promises.

THE ABDUCTION of a French diplomat's wife on Thursday has introduced a political dimension to the kidnap-for-ransom pestilence that has spread dramatically during the past 10 months. 
	
	
 The kidnap gang freed her and her driver within two hours of seizure. No ransom was paid. 
	
	
 The abduction, however, delivered a more devastating blow on the capacity of the Macapagal administration to crack down on kidnap syndicates than the grim statistics trotted out by Teresita Ang-See, the Chinese-Filipino anti-crime "crusader," who has relished the role of Cassandra to the Philippine National Police under the new administration. 
	
	
 Since 1992 when organized crime became a leading preoccupation in the national agenda, the main victims of the predatory syndicates have been Ang-See's compatriots in the Chinese-Filipino community. 
	
	
 The conventional explanation is that because of their wealth, they are the logical prey from which to extract ransom money--a perverse form of nationalist racism and redistribution of national wealth. 
	
	
 The Abu Sayyaf kidnapping of foreigners in Sipadan, Malaysia, and in Dos Palmas, Palawan, broke this ethnicity pattern. 
	
	
 But the seizure of the diplomat's wife and her driver was the first time in 10 years that the gangs struck at members of the diplomatic community, whose immunity has been somehow respected by organized syndicates. 
	
	
 The seizure sent alarm bells ringing in the diplomatic community in this country. The repercussions in the home governments and countries are as damaging as the prolonged hostage-taking by the Abu Sayyaf of French, German, Malaysian, Lebanese and Finnish nationals during the Estrada administration. 
	
	
 Then President Joseph Estrada had to cancel visits to Paris and other European capitals in 2000 after he was told that he would receive a hostile reception from the European public over the lengthy impasse of negotiations for the hostages' release. 
	
	
 From my own sources in the diplomatic community, as well as in the Philippine National Police, the diplomat's wife and her driver went to the French school in Bicutan at around 10 a.m., in response to a call from school authorities who reported that her son had some accident. 
	
	
 On the way, a group of about six armed men in uniforms blocked her brand-new car (which had no diplomatic plate) at Better Living Subdivision, Paranaque, and boarded it. 
	
	
 The gang drove the car around the vicinity while they interrogated the victims for about two hours. The hijackers asked them for money--one million pesos was mentioned--which she had supposedly withdrawn from the bank. She told them she had not withdrawn such money and that she was the wife of a senior French diplomat. The gunmen let her go. 
	
	
 The PNP, which believes it was a case of mistaken identity, could not explain why it took the gang two hours to know the identity of the lady. 
	
	
 After detaining them for about two hours, they drove her and the driver to a squatters' area and dropped them off near the Bicutan exit, but not before they took her necklace and wallet. 
	
	
 They did not take her ring and other pieces of jewelry. The gang fled with the car, and the victims took a tricycle home. The details of the crime and the swift release are less important than the political implications. Whether the incident was plain holdup, as the PNP would like to see it, the abduction reinforced the growing perception in the diplomatic community and foreign governments that there is a breakdown in law and order and that the Macapagal administration is not in control. 
	
	
 This perception is also fueled by the crime statistics of Ang-See, who represents the pessimistic outlook in contrast to the more dismissive outlook of the PNP whose statistics are less alarming than those of Ang-See. 
	
	
 While Ang-See's statistics, derived mainly from non-official sources, paint a grim picture, they should not be ignored. 
	
	
 At the same time, the PNP can't be burying its head in the sand and offering explanations all the time, rather than check the rise of kidnappings. 
	
	
 Ang-See's close collaboration with former PNP chief, now Sen. Panfilo Lacson, is an open secret. Some administration officials wonder whether she paints doomsday scenarios just to embarrass the administration and to portray the contrast in performance between the PNP under Lacson and the current PNP leadership, which has no love lost with Lacson. 
	
	
 Since the members of the diplomatic community had previously been immune from the predatory attacks of the gang, the abduction of the diplomat's wife naturally has generated anxieties among foreign governments about how safe their diplomats are in this country. 
	
	
 There is a strong perception in the diplomatic community that the abduction was a fake kidnap-for- ransom and was a political act to demonstrate the administration's incapacity to put crime under control. 
	
	
 The reasoning behind this perception is that if the gangs were after ransom money, it did not matter whether their victims belonged to the diplomatic community. 
	
	
 The perception is that there was a political message in the abductions staged by some groups that are determined to make this government fail. 
	
	
 A number of embassies here, including the American, French, German and Japanese, have issued advisories to their nationals warning them of risks when travelling in some parts of the country. 
	
	
 The advisories have been prompted by domestic lawlessness and political turbulence rather than by a possible outbreak of insidious terrorist attacks associated with al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden and provoked by the American military action in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 At the rate syndicates are abducting targets--regardless of their ethnic identity and their diplomatic status--with impunity, the administration faces a more serious and direct challenge to its capacity to govern from the specter of lawlessness than from the daunting problem of sparking an economic recovery amid the global economic downturn. 
	
	
 We don't need al-Qaida terrorist attacks in this country to bring the government down in turmoil, create uncertainties in the business community, and frighten tourists and investors away. 
	
	
 The diplomatic community's perception of President Macapagal is that she is organized, knows her economics, does her homework, and has been unscathed by scandals that have been rubbed on her skin by a scandal-mongering opposition. 
	
	
 But the downside is that the deterioration of peace and order is her nemesis that is undoing all her diplomatic initiatives in the world stage to project the Philippines as a staunch ally in the US-led coalition in the war on international terrorism. 
	
	
 Some diplomats raise questions about her priorities. They think she is travelling too much, while internal problems sap the country's energy, and that she has misplaced strategic priorities in her overseas visits. 
	
	
 The fire is raging at home, these sources say, not in the United States, China, Japan or Afghanistan. Her hoses have to be directed at internal terrorism. She has more dangerous enemies at home than elsewhere.	


	
Spanish daily blasts "meaningless" US announcement on Guantanamo detainees 
	
	
 Text of unsigned editorial headlined "The USA tramples on the rights of all the Guantanamo prisoners" published by Spanish newspaper El Mundo web site on 9|February 
	
	
 The White House spokesman announced the night before last that the Taleban prisoners being held in Guantanamo will enjoy the treatment envisaged under the Geneva Convention, but not the foreign prisoners from Al-Qai'dah, who the Bush administration considers terrorists. The Geneva Convention is the international treaty signed in 1949 by the USA and other countries, which regulates the treatment of prisoners of war and grants them a set of legal and humanitarian rights. Bush's spokesman added that none of the 158 detainees in Guantanamo is going to be given prisoner-of-war status, which makes the apparently positive part of the White House statement meaningless. The USA refuses to admit that these detainees are prisoners of war because, under the Convention, they would have the right not to answer any questions except to give their name and rank, they could not be tried except for war crimes and they would have to be repatriated after the war ends. So when the White House says it is going to treat the Taleban in accordance with the Geneva Convention, it is pure rhetoric, nothing other than a public relations exercise and will be meaningless in practice. The key issue is not so much whether they are treated humanely and their beliefs respected, but their legal status. If they don't enjoy the advantages of being prisoners of war and do not have the right to be tried under US criminal law, what jurisdiction will be used for these men being held incommunicado in a place that isn't the USA or Cuba? Nobody in the US government has answered this question, even though international organizations like the Red Cross and Human Rights Watch have denounced the defenceless situation of these prisoners, who have no access to lawyers and do not enjoy the minimum guarantees for judicial proceedings which, in their case, do not exist. Donald Rumsfeld and other senior Washington officials have tried to justify what is happening in Guantanamo on the grounds that the detainees are dangerous terrorists. That may be the case, but even the worst criminals have the right to a lawyer and to know the charges against them. It can only be paradoxical that a supposedly model democracy like the USA can trample on the law to such an extent. 
	
	
	


	
Norway should be in the forefront of combating climate problems. The government wants to play an active role internationally but we should also work on reducing emissions here at home. 
	
	
 "The government wants to point to a significant reduction of climate gate emissions before 2005 after Norway has ratified the Kyoto Protocol in the course of the year," Environmental Protection Minister Borge Brende has written. Between now and 2008, the government's environmental initiative will be given concrete form in a report to the Storting this spring, in which an early quota system will occupy a central place. 
	
	
 Norway and the other rich countries have a moral responsibility to achieve real reductions. Regardless of what Norway and other countries manage to do in this respect, we must prepare ourselves for climate changes. According to the United Nations' climate panel, in the next 10 to 20 years changes in the climate will be almost unaffected by what we do in the way of initiatives in the next few years to reduce emissions of climate gases. The explanation is that the increased concentration of climate gases in the atmosphere and the slowness of the climate system will make a certain degree of global warming unavoidable. 
	
	
 In recent years the RegClim research project, under the aegis of the Norwegian Research Council, has worked to estimate the way the climate will develop in Norway in 30 to 50 years. The main conclusions were that the trend toward warmer weather and more precipitation will presumably continue. 
	
	
 The climate changes will be different from region to region. The western part of Norway will experience the markedly greatest increase in precipition in the fall. North Norway will also get more precipitation in the fall but warmer temperatures in the winter. In the eastern part of Norway the biggest increase in precipitation will be in the winter. In coming years the winters will be less snowy but greener and wetter. 
	
	
 These extrapolations of the state of the climate are not completely reliable. Even if we can say with great certainty that climate changes will come, we need more knowledge about the effects . 
	
	
 How must local societies organize themselves if a couple of hurricanes every year become normal? How should we prepare ourselves for more and bigger floods? What consequences will the increase in temperature have for raising livestock and fish? Will climate changes produce new types of pests that will create problems? For the next few years our goal is to both gain more knowledge and put together good preparedness strategies. 
	
	
 All the world's countries and peoples are affected by climate changes but it is the poor countries that are being hit the hardest. Even if developing countries have contributed to these climate problems to just a slight degree, they will nevertheless bear the greatest burden. 
	
	
 Norway and other industrialized countries, on the other hand, have fairly good prospects of grappling with climate changes because we have an economy to put necessary measures to work. We must avoid seeing environmental problems increase the social differences in the world. For that reason the rich countries-those making the climate worse-must go on the offensive to solve the problems we ourselves have created. 
	
	
 In the Sem statement the coalition government warned of a more offensive climate policy. An offensive climate police will bring costs with it. But if we do not make these expenditures now, the bill for the generations to come will be even bigger. This our conscience ought not to permit us. 
	
	
 The challenge will be to introduce the most cost-effective climate policy possible and at the same time take Norwegian business and industry's competitiveness into consideration. 
	
	
 The elements in a more offensive climate policy are: 
	
	
 Initiatives between now and 2008: The government wants to show demonstrable progress in the reduction of climate emissions by 2005. We are setting the stage for Norway to get national initiatives under way earlier than we are required to under the Kyoto Protocol. The government's policy statement states, among other things, that the establishment of a national quota system should be speeded up. 
	
	
 Implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The government wants to set the stage for Norway to ratify the Kyoto Protocol next year. There is consensus that a broad quota system with international quota exchange should be used to achieve our emission responsibilities during the first obligatory period, 2008-2012. 
	
	
 Pursue the international climate negotiations. The consensus that has been achieved internationally about the period 2008-2012 is just the first step down the road. For later periods, sharper reductions are necessary and there is also the need to get more countries to take on climate obligations. Norway still wants to play an active role in this process. 
	
	
 The report to the Storting that the government is preparing for the spring will further specify which measures will be implemented between now and 2008. A proposal for an early quota system will be at the center of this report. There exists the potential for significant reductions in climate gas emissions in Norway that will not produced with today's resources. The use of quotas will be a cost-effective means of achieving better results. 
	
	
 A quota is a right to emit a certain quantity of climate gases during a certain period and this right can be sold on a market. The advantages are that the authorities can set a ceiling on all emissions. Businesses that are obligated by a quota can then choose whether they want to buy those quotas they need or introduce measures to reduce emissions. 
	
	
 Many countries, among them Denmark, Great Britain, and Sweden, are already under way developing early quota systems. In addition to being effective, an early quota system would also give business and industry useful experience before the international quota system following the Kyoto Protocol comes into effect in 2008. 
	
	
 In the government's work to put the quota system into shape in Norway, we are now discussing a number of problems. Some of these are: 
	
	
 The range-which gases and sectors should be included in the quota system, and how businesses exposed to competition should be dealt with. 
	
	
 Measures about emissions-how much all of those obligated by a quota can emit. 
	
	
 Fines for exceeding the quota limit. 
	
	
 The possibility of cooperating with other countries' early quota systems. 
	
	
 I am pleased that there now seems to be broad political consensus that in Norway as well we should get under way with an early quota system. 
	
	
 Regardless of the shape of the measures in Norway, Norwegian businesses as well ought to contribute to reducing emissions in poor countries. The green development mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol opens the way for businesses from industrialized countries to pay for the introduction of more environmentally-friendly technology in polluting industries in developing countries. This mechanism can already be used-and before 2008, too. In addition to producing climate benefits, such measures will contribute to development and reduced local pollution in poor countries. 
	
	
 Norway is one of the countries in this world that has earned the most from fossil fuels. This gives us a special responsibility in climate policy-not least vis-a-vis the poorest countries. 
	
	
	


	
Following the presidential vote in Zimbabwe, there is just one thing Robert Mugabe cannot be reproached for, and that is having made a secret of his determination to stay in power by every possible means. The electoral hijacking had been announced, prepared, and organized. It has now taken place. Should one be surprised? Since he nearly lost his parliamentary majority in June 2000, the head of state has stated and restated to his supporters that the presidential election was going to be a "war." He was as good as his word. 
	
	
 The "war for land" continued, at the risk of causing famine. The army swore allegiance to the "father of independence," regardless of the verdict at the ballot box. The independence of Zimbabwe's justice system was compromised. The local press was harassed. The opposition MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) was the victim of "state terrorism" that its candidate Morgan Tsvangirai rightly condemned after being beaten in an election loaded against him from start to finish, from drawing up the electoral lists to counting the votes. The real secret of the ballot box will never be revealed. 
	
	
 This "fait accompli" in Zimbabwe is a challenge for the international community. It can only rise to meet it by making some radical changes. Indignant protests apart, nothing was done to prevent the disaster awaiting one of the key countries in southern Africa, seen as the continent's growth pole. The weapon of so-called "intelligent" sanctions proved ineffective, especially as the punitive measures were taken too late and only served to deny Robert Mugabe and his associates trips abroad and access to the funds they have spirited away. They amounted to no more than a ban on holidays and a golden retirement. Finally and most importantly, Great Britain remained locked in the familiar psychodrama between the former colonizer and colonized. Africa, with its own "observers," has just ratified a shameful electoral sham. Kenya and Tanzania even "congratulated" Robert Mugabe on his re-election after the first round. 
	
	
 It is time to speak the language of truth. Either the absence of democracy in Africa is no longer any more of a problem for Europe than the lack of development, or it is time to get serious about "good governance" as a condition for aid. Either the New Partnership for African Development (Nepad) is merely to entertain the international gallery during the occasional conference on "sustainable development" or Africa must itself impose a minimum of probity and respect for fundamental liberties. It has the means. Robert Mugabe remains in power thanks to the maize, oil, and electricity he supplies to South Africa. In Zimbabwe it is better to have an end to the torment than torment without end. 
	
	
 Fortunately, Europe is no longer "Africa's policeman." But it must demand that the countries of Africa put their own house in order. 
	
	
 
	
	
	


	
Taipei, Jan. 3 (CNA) -- Premier Chang Chun-hsiung expressed alarm Thursday at reports that a legislator was kidnapped and held for three days in a Taipei hotel, saying that his government will do its utmost to stop gangsters from preying on lawmakers. 
	
	
 Presiding over an inter-agency conference on social order, Chang asked the police to catch the gangsters who allegedly detained Legislator Huang Hsien-chou at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Taipei. 
	
	
 Later that day, a man was arrested in Taipei in relation to the case. Chang Fu-shun, 27, is said to be the younger brother of Chang Hui-hua, who allegedly invited Huang to meet her at the hotel and who Huang claimed was in the hotel room when he was detained. 
	
	
 Huang claimed the previous day in Taichung that he had been trapped by the gangsters, who had pretended to be his political supporters. 
	
	
 Huang told reporters that the gangsters, who included at least two men and a woman, made an appointment to meet him at the hotel Dec. 26. When he arrived, he claimed, one of them offered him a drink and he lost consciousness after drinking it. 
	
	
 When he awoke, he found that his hands and feet had been bound. The gangsters demanded NT$2 million from him but finally settled for NT$800,000 which they withdrew using Huang's credit card. 
	
	
 Huang was released Dec. 31 and reported to police that day. 
	
	
 Huang revealed what he claimed to be the whole story at a news conference Wednesday night after press reports said he had in fact been caught with prostitutes in the hotel and blackmailed. 
	
	
 The police said that the hotel room had been paid for by a woman who checked in under the name of Lin An, which they said was an alias used by Chang Hui-hua. 
	
	
	


	
The great leader [yongdoja] Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: 
	
	
 "Although the imperialists and reactionaries speak ill of socialism and pretend to be the 'advocates of human rights,' they are the ones who really abuse human rights." 
	
	
 At a recent United Nations meeting, the United States picked a quarrel with us by speaking as if our country had a "human rights problem." This was not the first time the United States acted this way. More often than not, the United States, acting as if it were an "adjudicator of human rights," published the so-called "Annual Human Rights Report" and "Annual Report on International Religious Freedom," attempting to teach a lesson or two to countries -- including our country -- it deems disagreeable. 
	
	
 The United States, however, is not qualified to speak of "human rights" in other countries. One can easily talk in a similar manner of the racial discrimination in the United States which is becoming more serious with the passage of time. Many people in the United States have their human rights ruthlessly trampled upon simply because they are colored. 
	
	
 According to a poll conducted jointly by the US daily "The Washington Post" and Harvard University, people are wondering whether the American society is not reverting to the 1960s when racial discrimination was very serious. A total of 1,709 people, including blacks, Latinos, and Asians, participated in the poll. They responded that three out of ten blacks could not find job or have been denied responsible positions in the workplace simply because they were blacks and eight out of ten blacks and two thirds of the Latinos and Asians said they had suffered persecution and had been subjected to abusive language. 
	
	
 Ali Barr [name as published], a black man working at a TV station in Atlanta, has recently experienced racial discrimination in a restaurant. When Ali Barr and his company entered the restaurant, ten white people inside the restaurant appeared surprised to see them and a waitress told them to leave the premise immediately. Recalling the scene, Ali Barr said: "Myself and my company were racially discriminated against. I can never forget what I saw that day as long as I live." 
	
	
 As a result of racial discrimination, many among the ethnic minorities reportedly have been driven out of urban areas. According to 2000 vital statistics released not so long ago in the United States, one out of four residents of the suburban areas was an ethnic minority. This figure is said to be 5 percent higher than it was a decade ago. 
	
	
 People will likely remember the fact that the United States withdrew its delegation from the UN conference against racism held last September in Durban, South Africa. In the beginning, the United States refused to send a delegation, but eventually dispatched a low-level delegation. When voices critical of the Israelis' violation of the Palestinian people's human rights were raised at the conference, the United States went so far as to withdraw its delegation. 
	
	
 Since this is how a government claiming to represent its people behaves in international settings, it is no wonder people at home follow the government's example. 
	
	
 Instead of talking about "human rights issues" of other countries, the United States should find out how things are in its own house where the abuse of human rights is rampant and make effort to rectify the practices. 
	
	
	


	
AMMAN -- After months of low-profile activities, the 14 professional associations held their first anti-normalisation conference on Sunday during which they renewed calls for severing all ties with "the Zionist enemy." 
	
	
 More than 50 participants, most of them members of the unions' Anti-Normalisation Committee, took part in the one-day conference, held against a backdrop of uncertainty as to the future of the 10-year-old peace process. 
	
	
 The speakers outlined the plight of the Palestinians under occupation and the suffering of Iraqi people facing crippling international sanctions for the eleventh consecutive year. 
	
	
 They also lambasted "US-British aggression on Iraq and meddling in its internal affairs." 
	
	
 "Normalisation with the Zionist enemy is a crime against the country, nation and humanity," read one of the banners hoisted at the Professional Associations Complex. 
	
	
 According to Council of Unions' president Mohammad Oran, the anti- normalisation drive remains an Arab, Muslim and human goal. It is also a binding decision taken by the professional associations' general assembly, after Jordan sealed a peace treaty with Israel in October 1994. 
	
	
 Former Hamas spokesperson Ibrahim Ghosheh and spokesperson for the Muslim Brotherhood Jamil Abu Baker took part in the conference. 
	
	
 Sunday's gathering is the first such public event since authorities cracked down early last year on the anti-normalisation committee after they made public a blacklist of Jordanians they claimed had established "ties with the Jewish state." 
	
	
 During Sunday's conference, nine papers were discussed. 
	
	
 Political affiliation among association members lean heavily towards Islamist, pan-Arab and leftist groups. 
	
	
 Conference participants warned against Israeli "expansionist plans" and argued that the peace treaty was in favour of the "Zionist enemy." 
	
	
 They called for "ostracising" those who deal with Israeli partners and maintaining a total boycott of the Jewish state at the grassroots level. 
	
	
 On the official level, relations between Jordan and Israel have been strained since the outbreak of the Intifada 16 months ago. Jordan has delayed sending its ambassador designate, Abdul Ilah Kurdi, to Tel Aviv. 
	
	
 The conference also honoured the families of Jordanian detainees in Israeli jails. 
	
	
	


	
(CORR)Spanish premier, EU leader urge Russia to ratify Kyoto Protocol 
	
	
 (Correcting "handed over" in line 2 to read "sent". Corrected version follows.) 
	
	
 Text of report by Spanish news agency Efe 
	
	
 Barcelona, 14 March: The current president of the EU, Jose Maria Aznar, and the president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, have sent a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they urge him to promote the ratification by Russia of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. In the letter, to which Efe has had access, Aznar and Prodi explain that on 4 March the council of EU environment ministers agreed the adoption of a decision for approval of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change on behalf of the European Community. They explain that this agreement is an important step for the EU in fulfilling the political pledge to achieve ratification of the Protocol before the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development. To this end, Aznar and Prodi report that only the internal ratification processes in each of the member states have now to be concluded and they emphasize that these are at an advanced stage and in some cases have been completed. "Therefore, we have complete confidence that the instruments of ratification of the European Community and of the 15 member states will be able to be lodged with the Secretariat of the United Nations within the time scale anticipated, in other words, in early June of this year," they add. However, the letter emphasizes that for the Kyoto Protocol to be able to enter into force in the near future it is not enough for EU ratification to be guaranteed and they thus urge Putin to ensure that Russia also moves ahead with ratification. They make this request "convinced of the Russian Federation's resolute commitment to the Kyoto Protocol" and believing that in this manner the EU and Russia would continue to show the "leadership" which they believe they have shared "with such fruitful results, in international cooperation in the fight against climate change". 
	
	
	


	
If keeping Arafat captive, under siege with the Palestinian people by the Israeli occupying forces, is an affront to Palestinian, Arab dignity, and International justice, it is also a powder keg that will at one point explode, devastating what remains of the Israeli security. It is that same security that Sharon, the assassin, uses as an excuse to instigate struggles and wars, and promote instability. He also pretends that he besieges Arafat because so far, he was unable to confront the Palestinian resistance. 
	
	
 It is only natural, with the guerilla operations successively occur, even inside the fortified settlements, that the world begins to wonder whether the accusations that Arafat was planning, and instructing attacks on Israeli targets despite his captivity, and the round-the-clock Israeli surveillance, were founded. The only interpretation for these accusations is that Arafat has formidable supernatural powers that enable him to defend the rights of his homeland and people against the unlimited capabilities of the Israeli occupying forces equipped with all the mighty US weapon technology. 
	
	
 The failure of the US-made Israeli war machine to settle this unequal battle became clear in the farcical-yet-provocative, statements made by the Israeli minister of defense now present in Washington. He has called for helping aggressive Israel to put a traitorous agent at the head of the Palestinian Authority, who could accept its terms to "assassinate' the rights of Palestinians. 
	
	
 It is certain the Ben Eliezer's hallucination is a mere expression of failure to persuade the world to accept the brutality of the occupying forces' practices. They even embody the bankrupt policy of Israeli criminal extremism and failure to gain legitimacy for its continuing occupation of the Palestinian territories. 
	
	
 Ben Eliezer's raving coincided with the arrival of his assassin boss Sharon to Washington to take part in exerting pressures on the US administration, and persuade it that removing Arafat could bring about the Palestinian surrender, and halt violence as he calls it. Sharon and Ben Eliezer never stopped to consider that no patriotic Palestinian could accept to serve as a substitute agent to Israel. They, along with the extremist gang in the Israeli government, do not want to understand that Arafat symbolizes the Palestinian struggle. With this attitude, Sharon's government showed its true hostility for a leader and chairman elected by his people. US peace Envoy Burns has expressed this after his meeting with president Mubarak. He has declared that US contacts will continue with Arafat considering that he is the elected Palestinian chairman. 
	
	
 I do wish that Burns's statements reflect a true position that signals a return of balance to the US position in dealing with the reality of Palestinian-Israeli struggle. 
	
	
 The time has come, gentlemen, for Sharon, the assassin, to realize that injustice cannot last long. The security of the Israelis depends on the Palestinians' regaining their rights. By besieging Arafat, Sharon has turned him into the "Mandela" of Arab struggle. This foretells that the Israeli occupation's claims will inevitably falls, no matter how long Sharon humiliates Arab dignity, relaying on the protection and support of Washington, which forgot all principles and role in defending justice, and international legitimacy. 
	
	
	


	
OVER 2,374 Bayelsa State people have received free medical services for various ailments, courtesy of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). 
	
	
 A breakdown of the statistics of patients that benefited from the exercise showed that 106 received general surgeries, 20 had eye cataract operations, 260 got eye glasses, while 1, 988 others had general consultations. 
	
	
 Apart from Odi whose people topped the number of beneficiaries (they got 1, 733 out of 2, 374 persons treated), other councils which participated in the free health care are Kolokuma/Opukoma, 284 persons, Kaiama, 213 persons, among others. 
	
	
 Co-ordinator of the project, Mr Sean Nortman, told reporters that 52 volunteers from various fields in medicine help to make the project a reality. 
	
	
 "With the combined goal of providing free quality health care in this rural areas through the dispensing of prescribed drugs as well as undertaking surgeries that came to the medical site daily, we made it to give the patients we come in contact with health advice and education, hopefully to prevent further problems in the future," Nortman said. 
	
	
 In an interview with journalists later, NDDC Executive Director, Finance and Administration, Mr. Timi Alaibe, said that the choice of Odi was a deliberate policy to give the people of the area who are still recovering from the trauma of the 1999 sad incident a sense of belonging. 
	
	
 Alaibe said that the commission was genuinely determined to change the tide of things in Bayelsa and other NDDC states who have been long neglected over years. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, reports of investigation into the recent oil spillage that occurred in Umudike Ohaji Egbema council in Imo State which left eight persons dead and many others injured is ready. 
	
	
 The member representing the Ohaji Egbema Oguta Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives Tony Okere disclosed this on Wednesday while fielding questions from reporters in his constituency office. 
	
	
 He added that the report would be presented before the house as soon as it resumes sitting. 
	
	
 He said the compositions of the committee included representatives from the Directorate of Petroleum Resource of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), government, Shell and the host community to ensure justice and fairness, law to protect only one party" he said. 
	
	
 On the activities of the NDDC, Okere accused the commission of siting projects in non oil producing areas, warning that it might derail from its set objectives.	


	
Today, in order to find a correct solution to the Middle East issue, it is important to frustrate Israel's territorial ambition and create conditions for Palestine to create an independent state of its own. Apart from this, we cannot talk about the settlement of the Middle East issue. 
	
	
 The great leader [suryong] Comrade Kim Il-song taught: 
	
	
 "Imperialism is the source of war and the disturber of peace." 
	
	
 It is an urgent matter for Israel to withdraw completely from the occupied land of Palestine. 
	
	
 Israel makes itself appear to be withdrawing its troops from some of the occupied Palestinian autonomous areas. On 17 November, Israeli troops pulled out of Tulkarm, a West Bank area of the Jordan River. 
	
	
 However, this is no reason to be optimistic about the situation. 
	
	
 Toward the end of October, Israel declared that it would withdraw from some of the Palestinian autonomous areas where the situation was "relatively calm" and pretended to be abiding by the decision. However, it stopped withdrawing its troops halfway through under the pretext of "unstable situation" and occupied them again. There is no way of knowing whether or not Israel will halt the withdrawal of its troops again under any pretext as it did before. 
	
	
 On 18 November, the following day Israel began withdrawing its troops from Tulkarm, Israeli troops deliberately gunned down two Palestinians in the Palestinian autonomous areas as if they were quarries. On 20 November, the Israeli army bulldozed dwelling houses in the Palestinian autonomous area and even committed such an atrocious act as wounding Palestinians without hesitation. As a result, the situation has become tense again. 
	
	
 It was in fact due to strong international pressure that Israel began withdrawing its troops from the Palestinian autonomous area. 
	
	
 In September last year Israeli Prime Minister Sharon, the then leader of the opposition party, visited a holy place in Kuds [Jerusalem], throwing Israel and Palestine into a fierce fight. Sharon's remarks and behavior that were insulting to the Palestinians infuriated Palestine. The desperate fight even took tolls of women and children. 
	
	
 The clash between Israel and Palestine briefly appeared to be abating in the wake of the large-scale attack incident [taesupkyok sakon] against the United States. However, it has become fierce again after Israeli minister of tourism was assassinated. Taking advantage of this, Israel occupied six cities located in the Palestinian autonomous areas by the use of force. 
	
	
 The United Nations and many countries around the world began paying attention again to the situation in the Middle East that is becoming more complicated. International pressure is on Israel again. 
	
	
 Caving in to the international pressure, the United States pretended to support the creation of an independent Palestinian state. The United States, which is currently waging a war in Afghanistan, tried to shore up support from Arab states and Islamic world through a crafty ruse. Seeing through the US scheme, Israel refused to continue the troop withdrawal from the Palestinian autonomous area. 
	
	
 Israel has never abandoned its aggressive ambitions. 
	
	
 Convinced that the United States can never abandon it completely, Israel is dragging its feet on the withdrawal of troops citing a variety of excuses. 
	
	
 Israel is adamantly against the creation of a completely independent Palestinian state. Israel's scheme is to make Palestine a vassal state and bring it under its control. This is why Israel agreed to discuss the issue of granting independence to Palestine on conditions that Palestine claim only a small piece of territory and waive its right to raise [organize] a regular army. 
	
	
 As such, Israel's territorial ambition is persistent and clever. 
	
	
 The US administration is about to call on Israel to support the creation of a Palestinian state with East Kuds as its capital. 
	
	
 Commenting on this, many Arab states and international opinion emphatically said that it is nothing more than a political stratagem to win support for its war in Afghanistan and to further expand the sphere of its domination in the Middle East. 
	
	
 The United States, which has been in the van of invading other countries, is about to put pressure on Israel, not because it is now more sympathetic to Palestine or finds Palestine more tolerable than before, but because of its own national interests. 
	
	
 It is quite obvious that Israel will employ a crafty trick in the future to realize its burning territorial ambition. It is also obvious that the aggressive US policy toward the Middle East will remain unchanged. 
	
	
 The prospect for the settlement of the Middle East issue is still bleak due to those who stand in the way of the settlement. 
	
	
	


	
JOHANNESBURG March 16 Sapa MBEKI TO MEET WITH MUGABE AND TSVANGIRAI IN HARARE ON MONDAY 
	
	
 (CORRECTS TITLE OF AUSTRALIAN PM, UPDATES WITH ZUMA ATTENDING INAUGURATION) President Thabo Mbeki would fly to Harare on Monday to meet Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and later with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, presidential spokesman Bheki Khumalo told Sapa on Saturday. 
	
	
 Khumalo said Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo would also attend the talks, which would culminate on Tuesday when the two met Australian Prime Minister John Howard in London. Mugabe was to be inaugurated again as Zimbabwean president on Sunday following his controversial re-election last weekend. He was first elected Prime Minister in 1980 and has effectively ruled the country ever since. 
	
	
 Mbeki, Obasanjo and Howard have been mandated by the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Australia to decide what action should be taken on the situation in Zimbabwe. Their decision would be based on the Commonwealth observer team's report on the legitimacy of the election as well as those prepared by the Southern African Development Community, the Organisation of African Unity and the SA Observer Mission. The Commonwealth team earlier this week said that "the conditions in Zimbabwe did not adequately allow the free and fair expression of will by the electorate". 
	
	
 The SADC on Saturday endorsed the vote, despite its Parliamentary Forum, which judging that the March 9-11 election "did not conform with the norms and standards of the SADC Parliamentary Forum," signed on to by Zimbabwe. The team from the organisation's Council of Ministers, on the other hand, considered the vote a "true reflection" of the people's will. 
	
	
 The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) also backed Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's re-election, with its observer team describing the poll as "transparent, credible, free and fair". South Africa's observer mission also endorsed the vote, saying in an interim report that "(o)verall ... the authorities charged with conducting the elections discharged their work satisfactorily." The team acknowledged that the election campaign had been characterised by "polarisation, tension and incidents of violence and intimidation." In terms of the Commonwealth's mandate, action against Zimbabwe could range from collective disapproval to suspension. 
	
	
 Mbeki was, however, already on the record as saying that the Commonwealth also had other issues to consider. CHOGM had also decided to look at ways of helping Zimbabwe with land reform and food aid. State-sanctioned land invasions, several times declared illegal by Zimbabwe's courts, as well as a drought have disrupted Zimbabwe's food production and famine is already looming in much of the country. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said Mbeki's deputy, Jacob Zuma would represent the country at the controversially re-elected President Robert Mugabe's latest inauguration, scheduled for Sunday in Harare. No reason was provided why Mbeki could not attend. Reports from Lagos indicated that Obasanjo would also not attend. 
	
	
 Several other heads of state had by Saturday indicated they would attend, including Tanzania's Benjamin Nkapa and Malawi's Bakili Muluzi, currently also the SADC's president. Mamoepa said the key points on the agenda now was Zimbabwe's economic recovery and social stability "within the context of national unity."

Tomorrow the government will announce a comprehensive economic and social plan based on the complete elimination of the dollar as a monetary standard through the conversion of deposits and loans into pesos. 
	
	
 For those owing less than $100,000, the conversion will be done at the rate of one to one. For those who owe between $100,000 and $300,000, the conversion rate will be 1.2 to 1, with the government making up the difference between this rate and that of the official dollar. It will help out the banks, as El Cronista reported, by giving them a bond or certificate against future revenues from the tax on crude oil exports (5 billion) and with part of the assistance that the IMF will reportedly provide (4 billion). Debts of more than $300,000 will continue to be converted at 1.4 to 1. 
	
	
 Barring last minute changes, no announcement is expected about allowing the peso to float freely, as the IMF would like, or about changes in the timetable for easing bank withdrawal restrictions. Under these restrictions, which were established by Domingo Cavallo and tightened by his successor, Jorge Remes Lenicov, the country's savers are barred from accessing more than 65 billion (pesos and mainly dollars) that they have on deposit. 
	
	
 This constraint, combined with the difficulties of even withdrawing money for daily use from salary direct-deposit accounts, has heightened social unrest, as people have staged marches, banging on pots and pans, and other demonstrations to protest the prevailing economic situation. 
	
	
 Some analysts feel that the fledgling Duhalde administration is making a mistake by ending convertibility without first resolving the problems that will arise from this decision, which was a foregone conclusion here in Argentina and the rest of the world. What is more, the IMF tried to convince Cavallo to abandon the one-to-one peg in an orderly fashion. 
	
	
 The fact that the former minister and President Fernando de la Rua, who later stepped down, were opposed to such a move drove the IMF even further away from lending any support. Its last show of support was the $8 billion in aid to support the "zero deficit" tactic. 
	
	
 Such budgetary discipline turned out to be impossible, thus shattering the rigid convertibility system and putting entire sectors of the economy out of commission. Lack of confidence led to massive withdrawals of savings into safer places. 
	
	
 The outflows forced some banks to ask the government to set limits. Cavallo could think of nothing better than the curbs on withdrawals. According to former Minister Roque Fernandez, it was "the worst mistake in the history of the Argentine economy," while influential businessman Arnaldo Musich (FIEL [Latin American Economic Research Foundation]-Techint) considered it an "inexcusable" mistake. 
	
	
 Burdensome Legacy 
	
	
 The last of the provisional governments that took over from the abbreviated De la Rua administration decided quickly to end the currency board system. But not until tomorrow, one month after taking office, will it announce a comprehensive plan to overcome the worst crisis in the country's history. 
	
	
 Duhalde will confirm that $2 billion will be made available immediately to mitigate the social disaster. This money was approved by the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. 
	
	
 Accompanied by Remes, he will talk tomorrow about what the assistance will be used for: to fulfill the promise to create a million jobs, to provide basic health care, and to undertake small infrastructure projects. The president will also mention imminent political reform, which he will call on Congress to enact. 
	
	
 The rest of his remarks will be solely about the economy, about which millions of Argentines have been obsessed for some years now. Mortgage loans, the debts of small and mid-sized companies, and automotive loans under $100,000 will be paid back in the identical amount of pesos. The same will go for secured loans under $300,000 and personal loans of up to $10,000. 
	
	
 Debts over these amounts will have to be repaid at 1.4 to 1, although the government will defray 20 cents on the dollar so that debtors will actually pay 1.2 pesos. 
	
	
 The banking restrictions will, for the time being, remain unchanged, but the tacit assumption is that the timetable for easing them will be speeded up "as soon as conditions permit." It has been confirmed that there will be "coupons" for savers who want to buy things, with their frozen funds as collateral. 
	
	
 The president will also break down the budget for the press and promise to issue currency in a controlled manner (not to exceed 3.5 billion pesos) and to undertake the difficult task of reversing the sudden decline in wealth (4.9 percent) without pushing inflation beyond 15 percent. 
	
	
 The dollar will be allowed to float as soon as possible, as the government has promised the IMF. Everything depends on the anticipated aid of between $15 billion and $20 billion, which is what has been requested of Washington. 
	
	
 Adjustment Index Will Be New Variable 
	
	
 One of the points on which the Duhalde administration's economic plan will be based is a monetary benchmark that will govern the issuance of pesos and the refunding of deposits in dollars that have been frozen in accounts. 
	
	
 To this end, Jorge Remes Lenicov's economic team has developed an index or formula including such parameters as projected annual inflation rates, the government's budget, the exchange rate of the dollar, and issuance of money by the Central Bank. 
	
	
 This system, which will serve as a financial tool for redrafting most of the contracts involving economic activity in the new, post-convertibility era, is similar to the "Celic" index that Brazil uses or the "Unidad de Fomento" that Chile used until August 2001. 
	
	
 The monetary benchmark that Brazil employs and that Chile used to is the most common one in today's world and is based on an inflation target. On the basis of this target a rule is developed to determine the interest rate needed to hit the target for price rises. The amount of money issued thus winds up being a function of these variables, not a target in itself, so that monetary policy can be used as a tool for promoting economic recovery. 
	
	
 Until August of last year Chile had an incremental adjustment mechanism that included an exchange rate band with a ceiling and floor. Monetary adjustments were based on what was called the "unidad de fomento," an indexing system that included various price indices and adjusted contracts in accordance with actual changes. 
	
	
 Brazil started using an inflation target once its 1999 devaluation stabilized the real and achieved low inflation. 
	
	
 The government explained that it theoretically saw tools like the "unidad de fomento" as a way of adjusting the deposits of savers that will remain subject to restrictions until at least next year. The index will persumably not be applied for another two or three months, and it has not been ruled out that it may include loans already converted into pesos. 
	
	
 Renes is working alongside a group of technicians from the IMF, World Bank, US Treasury Department, and Central Bank of Brazil, whose services were also used during the crises in Mexico and Indonesia. 
	
	
 [Buenos Aires Ambito Financiero in Spanish on 1 February adds the following: "The following are the main measures that will be announced tomorrow: 
	
	
 "'Dirty' float for the dollar: The decision has been made to abolish the official exchange rate (1.4 pesos to the dollar) and to move towards a single, floating rate. The Central Bank will intervene in the market, but only to prevent sudden swings. Intermediate solutions have been completely ruled out, such as periodic adjustments of the exchange rate (a crawling peg) or a band, which would oblige the Central Bank to intervene by selling dollars to defend a given value of the peso. The government wanted to wait until it had sealed an accord with the IMF before going to a float. But since the negotiations will take several weeks, as Remes will not be flying to Washington until 14 February, the idea is to move ahead before receiving international aid. Another possibility is to have released at least the $2.6 billion that has been pending disbursement since December in order to bolster reserves before the peso is allowed to float. 
	
	
 "Total release of salary direct-deposit accounts: All employees will soon be able to access their entire salary by making cash withdrawals from savings accounts. This will completely eliminate the ceiling of 1,500 pesos per month that had been set in the January version of the banking restrictions. This measure will benefit only the 4 percent of workers who earn more than that amount, which until now was subject to the restrictions. The danger, which the economic team is aware of, is that any additional money withdrawn will go straight into purchases of dollars since this could represent the percentage of income that an individual is able to save. The measure is designed to send a signal so that people gradually regain confidence. Raising the withdrawal ceiling in the case of regular savings accounts to 1,500 pesos a month was under consideration yesterday, but for now the limit of 1,200 a month will continue to apply, with the possibility of gradual increases in the near future. 
	
	
 "Deposits to be converted into pesos at 1.4 to 1: Time deposits in dollars will be converted into pesos at the official rate. Once they have been converted, the refund timetable for dollar deposits will initially be maintained. In other words, refunds will not begin until January 2003. If an agreement is reached with the IMF and economic conditions improve, the timetable will likely be moved forward so that people can get cash. The possibility of keeping a portion of a time deposit in dollars, which President Duhalde has requested, has not been altogether ruled out, but there are legal problems with implementing it. In the case of time deposits in pesos, the refund timetable is being maintained; it provides for withdrawals in cash as of March. 
	
	
 "Installment checks for time deposits: The money subject to a refund timetable may be used for purchases, but with restrictions. It cannot be credited to demand deposit accounts. Therefore, it can be used only to purchase items such as cars and apartments. The 12, 18, or 24 installments into which time deposits will be divided, depending on their amount, may be endorsed. Transfer of the time deposit will be authorized only in the case of a purchase. But the account holder will not be able to move it from one bank to another. The big drawback to this system is that hardly anyone will be willing to sell real estate for peso-denominated installment checks that can be cashed sometime in the future. They can be used, though, for smaller transactions or to pay for part of a purchase. 
	
	
 "Issuance of bonds indexed according to the value of the dollar: The Central Bank will soon start issuing bonds in pesos to offer the public another alternative to purchasing dollars. The idea is to issue very short-term bills (30 days, for now) that will be indexed to any ongoing depreciation. An arrangement with an attractive implicit interest rate could also be devised. It will not be easy, of course, to drum up demand with the country in full-fledged default. 
	
	
 "No withholding on oil exports: In conclusion, the government has decided to reverse itself on the 20 percent tax that it was planning to levy on these exports. 'We would not have raised all that much money and would have been sending a very bad signal overseas by discriminating between sectors,' acknowledged a senior source in the Economy Ministry. In any event, the oil industry may be asked for an advance on taxes due, as had been under consideration a couple of weeks ago. If any withholding arrangement is implemented, it will apply to all exports, not just some. 
	
	
 "Bonds in dollars to compensate banks: The banks will receive long-term government bonds in dollars as compensation for the losses that will arise from conversion into pesos on their balance sheets. Estimates are that under the arrangement that has been devised the red ink will total more than 12 billion pesos or some $6 billion. The banks have also agreed with this option. They wold rather hold a financial claim on the government than place the entire burden on their debtors, who would be forced to declare bankruptcy if they got no relief. 
	
	
 "Phase 1 of the swap remains in dollars: Banks, Pension and Retirement Fund Management Companies, and insurance companies exerted strong pressure to prevent all accounts from being converted into pesos at 1.4 to 1. They managed to keep their bonds in foreign currency and are supposed to start collecting interest this April. It is likely, however, that before that the government will move ahead with a comprehensive debt rescheduling, including international and local investors who were involved in the first phase of the swap."] 
	
	
	


	
Hamburg -- Some 200 German Border Guard officers working in cooperation with the Hamburg prosecutors' office on Wednesday cracked a ring of Afghan smugglers who have been operating throughout Europe. 
	
	
 Officials say that the smuggling ring had been illegally bringing fellow nationals into Germany via Austria since at least October 2001. Many of the refugees then travelled by rail from Hamburg to Britain via Brussels. Others took trains, vans and cars onto ferries destined for Scandinavia. The Afghans paid gang members up to 9,000 euros ($7,900) to make the trip. 
	
	
 The border guard officers searched a total of 16 apartments, stores and offices downtown and in Hamburg's Altona, Billstedt, Schnelsen, and Harburg districts, detaining 14 suspects. An arrest warrant for the suspected leader of the gang, an Afghan, was also served. Police seized 33,9000 euros -- believed to be earnings from smuggling operations -- in the apartment of the 35-year-old suspected ringleader. 
	
	
 Two men who were working with him, an Afghan and a Pakistani, were arrested as well. Eleven others were taken into custody, seven of whom were also members of the smuggling ring. The remaining four turned out to be Afghan refugees. A further four suspects were arrested in a similar operation in Frankfurt. 
	
	
 Police interrogators were told the refugees had been "parked" and were working illegally in northern Germany until they could be moved to other locations. 
	
	
 Sites in the towns of Ratzeburg and Uelzen were also searched in connection with the raid, said Wieland Mozdzynski, director of the Hamburg office of the border guard. 
	
	
 Mr. Mozdzynski said that during the operation, which stretched as far as the state of Bavaria and Austria, police had uncovered an "international network of groups, each with specific tasks." He added that the groups worked independently, but exploited existing contacts regularly. According to a police spokesman, more than 500 officers took part in the joint operation. 
	
	
 Another officer said the loose structure of the smuggling ring made the investigation more difficult. He said that the bust was nevertheless a significant and successful strike against gangs and businesses engaged in human smuggling.	


	
Kazakhstan's main seaport does brisk business

 Baykonur, 15 March: Preparations on the Progress M-1 N257 transport spacecraft, which is scheduled to be launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on 21 March, are nearing completion at the Baykonur space vehicle launching site [in Kazakhstan]. Specialists at the space vehicle launching site told an Interfax-Kazakhstan news agency correspondent that Progress had been filled with rocket fuel components and compressed gases and it had been taken to an installing and testing facility of the Energiya [Energy] Rocket Space Corporation for the final operations to be carried out. The general assembly of the Soyuz-U booster-rocket (BR), which is to boost Progress M-1, is scheduled for 18 March. After the BR has been assembled, the state commission will take a decision to take the rocket to the launching site. A total of six space launches from Baykonur, including four cargo launches, scheduled within the ISS programme this year.	


	
New York -- The warlike tone of the State of the Union speech delivered by George Bush Tuesday evening has prompted responses as critical abroad as they are enthusiastic in the United States. Be that as it may, the aim pursued by the White House seems to have been achieved. This is to re-mobilize the country behind the war on terrorism and to prevent Americans, by returning to a more normal life, from concerning themselves chiefly with the daily repercussions of the Enron affair and rising unemployment. 
	
	
 In his fellow countrymen's eyes, the test constituted by 11 September has revealed George Bush's talents as a war leader. He is clearly more comfortable in this role than he is in he management of routine matters. His force of conviction when he preaches the struggle of good against evil largely explains his exceptional popularity ratings (83 percent of favorable opinions, according to the latest ABC and Washington Post surveys.) So on Tuesday evening George Bush tried to reproduce the tone of his 20 September speech in order to galvanize the country. "The United States will not allow the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the most destructive weapons. Whatever the cost of our country's defense, we will pay it. The evil is real, and it must be combated... even in the midst of tragedy, specially in the midst of tragedy, God is there..." 
	
	
 The unanimous opinion of the media is that he was successful in this. His speech was "brilliant, full of strength and eloquence. The pursuit of the war on terrorism has given Americans a new illustration of his character and his confidence in the country's leadership," the New York Times said. According to the Washington Post , "the President's intensity was equal to the need to pursue the war." Television commentaries were even more full of praise. "Solid and often eloquent remarks," CBS' Ran Rather said. CNN's Bill Bennett called it "a speech of moral strength." According to Fox's Juan Williams, "the words came straight from the heart." 
	
	
 The condemnation of the "axis of evil" comprising Iran, Iraq, and North Korea was applauded by Republican and Democrat hawks, and barely challenged by a few foreign relations experts. George Bush has succeeded not only in returning the war to the front pages of the newspapers, ousting the Enron affair and the budget deficit, but also in forcing the Democratic opposition to unite against the enemy. Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, and Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader in the Senate, have attempted the impossible feat of "setting partisan attitudes aside and supporting our President 100 percent in the war on terrorism," while at the same time trying to criticize economic and social policy. 
	
	
 As for responses abroad, in order to make them somewhat less sharp, the administration has introduced some qualifications. This, among other things, by specifying that no military operations are planned against any of the three countries cited. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer even added that the expression "axis of evil" was not used in an allusion to the notorious Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis. 
	
	
 However, George Bush is not about to change his rhetoric. "In the antiterrorist struggle, as far as I am concerned there is black and white, and no shades of gray," he said Thursday 31 January during an election campaign visit to Atlanta, Georgia, and to Daytona beach, Florida. 
	
	
 The President said he was confident about the US allies' support against countries trying to acquire mass destruction weapons. "The rest of the world needs to be with us, because such weapons can be targeted on them as well as on us." He again urged these countries to "clean their own homes." "If you are one of the countries that develops mass destruction weapons, and you are willing to ally with a terrorist group, or you currently support terrorism, or if you do not sincerely share the values precious to us, then you too will be under surveillance," he said. 
	
	
	


	
Cuito, 25 Jan (Angop)- A road convoy which came in from Benguela Province carrying 1,500 metric tons of assorted goods arrived in the city of Cuito, the capital of Bie Province, on Tuesday [22 Jan]. The aim of this aid is to reduce the shortages faced by local population. 
	
	
 According to convoy chief Eusebio da Silva Ferreira, the convoy included 35 trucks, and it ferried 720 metric tons of corn, 623 metric tons of peas, and 157 metric tons of beans. He added that the above mentioned products will help offset the difficult social conditions of more than 460,000 people in need in the province. 
	
	
 These aid goods have arrived at a time when the World Food Program, WFP is cutting down on air transportation of aid to Bie Province from 3,500 metric tons to 2,000 metric tons. This is because of the high costs involved, and the poor conditions of the local landing strip. Because of these problems, the WFP has not been able to provide all the necessary assistance to people in need, who are estimated to total more than 460,000. 
	
	
	


	
These days, when everything seems to be collapsing in the Middle East, both the Palestinians' chances of finally having a state in which their people would be sovereign, and the Israelis' chances of integrating themselves into a region where -- need we be reminded? -- the Arabs are in the overwhelming majority, we believe it our duty to voice a few basic truths. 
	
	
 One of us is a Palestinian patriot (and not a nationalist). The other has no other homeland than France, which does not, however, lead him to deny his heritage from ancient Israel (which contains, like all heritages, the best and the worst) nor to be indifferent to the destiny of those millions of Jews who have something in common with him. 
	
	
 We are both historians. 
	
	
 However, we will not look back at the entire century that has just passed. There was a quarrel concerning Zionism. Those involved in it had no shortage of arguments, whether Arab, Jewish, or simply clear-headed. Zionism established itself in a sensitive region of the world at a time when nothing seemed more "normal" than to settle in someone else's territory. 
	
	
 The United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand were all created at the conclusion of a colonial process. 
	
	
 No one today challenges their existence despite the crises arising from this process and which were cited by an Aboriginal athlete at the Olympic Games in Sydney. 
	
	
 Likewise, the more recent creation of Israel was accompanied, under the indifferent gaze of the Western and Soviet world, by the forced exodus of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Today, these refugees and their descendants do not call into question the existence of the state of Israel as long as the injustice suffered is recognized and the implementation of their rights is negotiated fairly. 
	
	
 Let us content ourselves with reiterating the evidence: Since June 1967, the West Bank and Gaza have been occupied and dominated territories, crushed politically, socially, economically. Despite this, the Palestinian resistance has formally recognized the existence of Israel and begun a peace process in Oslo, while the state of Israel has recognized the Palestinians represented by the PLO and its leader Yasser Arafat. 
	
	
 This process has not achieved its goal. 
	
	
 On the Palestinian side, feeding on the growing frustration of the occupied population, a wing has broken off, conducting a policy of terror and death that horrifies us. 
	
	
 On the Israeli side, despite the process, settlement has increased considerably, eating away at the supposedly autonomous Palestinian territories crisscrossed by "bypass roads." 
	
	
 Today, two forms of terrorism fuel each other. Palestinian terrorism, which existed on a very small scale in the time of Yitzhak Rabin, has taken on a dramatic dimension. But the Israeli response, with its "extra-judicial liquidations," is even more dramatic in a certain sense. It now resembles the destruction of the very people, so structured and organized is it. 
	
	
 Like any form of state terrorism, it is above all contradictory. Yesterday, Yasser Arafat was being asked to police the area he was supposed to be in charge of, while destroying the instruments of his power. Today, he is being completely isolated and the desire to drive him away is scarcely disguised. 
	
	
 Ariel Sharon's immediate exploitation of the 11 September massacres is an unmistakable sign. Sharon compared Arafat to Bin Ladin and Mullah Omar put together. Whom does he think he resembles, if not the perpetrator of the Sabra and Shatila massacres? 
	
	
 How to escape from this situation? From the current perspective, three solutions seem "logical." 
	
	
 The first is the expulsion of the Palestinians from what is known as Eretz Israel, from all of Mandatory Palestine. A recently assassinated minister favored this solution. Can we seriously imagine the crimes that would have to be committed to achieve this result? Can anyone believe that the Arab world could approve of it? What would then remain of the universal character of the prophets of Israel -- that of the second Isaiah, for example -- and of Israeli citizens' hope of one day living in peace in this region? 
	
	
 The other solution is the opposite of the first one: the departure of the Israelis to more hospitable climes, in the United States or Europe. It is absolutely impossible for the time being. But in the future? What would remain of the ideals of those who saw themselves as their liberators of their people and as builders? Asking this question at least serves as a reminder that, although many have already left, thereby reinventing the Diaspora, the Israelis want to stay and do not intend to end up like French Algeria. 
	
	
 The third solution consists of coexistence, whether it takes the form of two separate states or a federation or a confederation. 
	
	
 Two basic principles could still, perhaps, make it possible. 
	
	
 The first is that of not only civic, but also social and economic, equality. This principle applies primarily to the attitudes that must prevail during any future negotiations. It also applies for Palestinian citizens of Israel who, 53 years after the creation of the state, are still far from equal. It furthermore holds for the Israelis who decide to remain in Palestinian territory and who must no longer be encysted there. 
	
	
 The second is that of reciprocity. Any renunciation of sovereignty by either party must be compensated by the other. This applies to all the problems under discussion, including, of course, the issue of Jerusalem and of the refugees. 
	
	
 It must be acknowledged that the government of Ariel Sharon has so far taken the opposite tack and that, while he has grudgingly recognized the Palestinians' right to a state, it has been under conditions such that this state, reduced to a series of Bantustans, has no chance of living and developing peacefully. Extremists on both sides have clearly understood this and have derived nothing but encouragement from it. 
	
	
 The Israeli ambassador in France, Elie Barnavi, recently made two contradictory statements: That all those who, like Nurit Peled, believe that the Sharon government is a "government of death" could easily fit into a telephone booth... and that by their existence they constitute Israel's very honor. 
	
	
 We still want to hope that the "rest of Israel," as the prophets called it, is the "mustard seed" another prophet referred to. 
	
	
 We do hope so, against all hope. 
	
	
	


	
December 5, was a Wednesday like any other for the 24 executive directors of the International Monetary Fund [IMF]. Three meetings - on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays - under the chairmanship of the institution's director general, Germany's Horst Kohler, usually punctuate their weekly schedule. During these meetings, they review various subjects and in particular the achievements of "under program" countries. That particular morning, it was Argentina's turn. It is the victim of an explosive situation at the economic, political and social levels. And yet, the problem was disposed of in two hours. Since the economic targets the government had promised, particularly the one on a zero budget deficit, were not reached, the board felt it was unable to "recommend" releasing a new $1.264 billion tranche that had been scheduled for December as part of last year's $22 billion program for Argentina. 
	
	
 Shortly thereafter, the institution's spokesman, Thomas Dawson, declared "the [Argentine] authorities have to reach the program goals they set for themselves" before they can get any more money. Moreover, he found the measures taken by the government to control the [movement] of foreign exchange and limit the flight of capital were "regrettable", even though these measures were made more flexible later on. According to an eyewitness, this cut and dry, accounting-like decision taken by civil servants, who thus have the power of "life or death" over a country, was not the subject of any debate. It was taken following the presentation of a report by Chile's Thomas Reichmann, the chief of mission who had been sent to Buenos Aires. The figures spoke for themselves. At most, a few differences in sensitivity emerged over whether or not the issue should remain closed from one to two months or if the discussions with Argentina should continue. The latter was adopted in the end. This was the only concession made to a government that has been struggling to restructure its domestic public debt to avoid having the country simply default on its debt. 
	
	
 Unconditional Support 
	
	
 In essence, it seems that they all agreed on one thing: meeting a commitment is inviolable. This position is surprising all the same because the history of the IMF is lined with derogations. We have stopped counting the number of times financial bailout plans have been set up to help this or that government in difficulty. We also stopped counting the unconditional support the institution has given some heads of state, who are neither especially virtuous nor especially democratic, because it was in the political, commercial and economic interest of the United States to do so. 
	
	
 This was the case in particular for Russia, Brazil and now Pakistan. In the case of Russia, it was a matter of helping the former soviet giant consolidate its emerging democracy. For Brazil, the Fund intervened in October 1998, between two rounds in the presidential election, to support Fernando Henrique Cardoso's reelection because his macroeconomic options fell in line with the Fund's requirements, contrary to his leftist adversary, Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva. In the case of Pakistan, it is this country's geostrategic position in the current crisis that serves to justify the avalanche of loans and trade facilities that are being granted to Islamabad. 
	
	
 Argentina has none of these worthy arguments. Yet, over the past ten years, it has done everything it can to be considered one of the IMF's good pupils. The government adopted a fixed parity between the dollar and the peso in 1991 in order to stop unrestricted inflation. Buenos Aires privatized, on Washington's recommendation, all of its public companies. The government, without assets to sell and without the possibility of falling back on the devaluation of its currency, is now condemned to keep on asking for foreign capital to maintain its balance of payments in equilibrium. Hence, a foreign debt of $130 billion and the urgent need for an inflow of capital from the IMF to repay $2 billion in debt that is coming due on 19 December. In the event of non-payment, the country will find itself an outcast of the international financial community. 
	
	
 The IMF administrators' bookkeeping-based decision marks a toughening of its policy, which America's republicans, who are especially critical of the Fund's past largesse, have called for over the past years. The first illustration of a change in the position of the United States (the Fund's leading shareholder) toward countries that may squander the American taxpayer's money was the arrival in September of Ann Krueger, an ultraliberal American, as number two at the IMF. Moreover, the "Argentine case" falls at a bad time. President Bush now needs parliamentary votes to get more powers on trade negotiation matters and a green light on the economic stimulation plan that has been dragging along for the past two months. The president could not take any risk of ruffling the republicans. Furthermore, Argentina is not a priority for the Americans now, confides a member of the IMF. Also, the risk that its bankruptcy will cause a chain reaction and lead to a grave crisis among emerging nations is, according to economists, not very likely or at most limited. Brazil has had time to lessen its dependence on trade links with Argentina. The other emerging nations are calling on foreign capital less since the Asian crisis and a sharp ebb in investments would not have the dramatic impact that it had in 1997-1998. Will Argentina be declared bankrupt on 19 December? The fate of 30 million Argentines depends on this. Regardless of what happens, the current extremely perilous situation is another setback for the IMF. It has been following Argentina's national accounting with a magnifying glass for the past ten years and it has shown it is incapable of guaranteeing the country's financial equilibrium just as most of the countries that submit to its demands.

 The US President preferred a more realistic attitude, because it is hard to believe that it will be possible to fully eliminate pollutant gas emissions in one decade. What is also realistic is the idea that it will be easier to persuade the main polluting agents to take measures by providing incentives to them, rather than by constraint. No matter how cynical this may appear, the US administration is mainly concerned with getting out of the recession and with relaunching the economy, rather than with the greenhouse effect.	


	
That Angela Merkel, the chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Union, wanted the job had long been an open secret, although no one but she knew how far she was prepared to go. But it was the uncertainty with which her rival, Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber of the Christian Social Union, the CDU's Bavarian sister party, also shrouded himself that made the question of who would lead the Union parties into the 22 September elections as chancellor candidate against incumbent Gerhard Schroeder, so exciting. Mr. Stoiber has come a long way from his refusal to sacrifice himself for the CDU in an election that once looked impossible to win, through his statement that he would under no circumstances run against the wishes of Ms. Merkel and her party, to his willingness to take her on in a divisive vote if necessary. 
	
	
 Mr. Stoiber carefully tread the path to the candidacy, spurred on by many and reined in by others. But he let slip the opportunities to turn back, because the forces that drive him -- his desire to affect change, his sense of duty to his peers and his ambition -- would not permit him to pass up the biggest chance of his political life. Mr. Stoiber seized it once the CDU made clear that it preferred him to its own chairwoman. That has always been the basic premise for a CSU chairman to accept the candidacy on behalf of the bigger sister party. It does not, of course, guarantee success at the polls -- or even solidarity in the campaign. 
	
	
 Certainly, Mr. Stoiber has done everything in his power to spare himself the fate of his mentor, Franz Josef Strauss. Rather than force himself on the CDU, he waited to be called. Having marginalized their own leader, the CDU grandees cannot afford to leave the chancellor candidate in the lurch as well. The most cogent argument in Mr. Stoiber's favor is that he will be running as a hopeful and not as the ticket of last resort. The CDU chose him because it believes in victory. The government is floundering, more seriously than anyone would have thought six months ago. The Union parties could not have wished for a better situation from which to launch their campaign. If anyone in their ranks can turn this to their advantage, it is Mr. Stoiber. 
	
	
 Nonetheless, he will be made to realize that he cannot command the CDU, that his power base lies in Munich and not in Berlin, and that the invitation of kingmakers to accept the crown comes at a cost. Nor will Mr. Stoiber have any illusions of what it means to lead an election campaign, although he can be confident in the knowledge that what is at stake is not Edmund Stoiber, nor the Union, but Germany as a whole.

 Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA) -- Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien said Monday he does not expect any surprise developments to come from U.S. President George W. Bush's visit to mainland China later this week. 
	
	
 "The United States has more than once briefed us on the main purposes of Bush's Asia tour before his departure and repeatedly guaranteed that Taiwan's interests won't be sacrificed during Bush's trip," Chien told a news conference. 
	
	
 Bush arrived in Japan Sunday at the start of a three-nation Asia tour that will also take him to South Korea and mainland China. 
	
	
 Noting that this is Bush's first visit to the Asia-Pacific area following his attendance at the annual informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum last October, Chien said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is keeping close tabs on the current trip. 
	
	
 According to Chien, the government has set up a special task force to facilitate communications with the United States and analyze relevant developments. "The task force is working around the clock to monitor Bush's visit to Japan, south Korea and mainland China," he added. 
	
	
 The minister further said that since the communication channels between Taiwan and the United States have been operating smoothly, MOFA can fully grasp any possible developments. "We hope that people will keep calm. They need not be nervous," he said. 
	
	
 Chien said he appreciated statements made by Bush prior to his departure that Taiwan is a friend of the United States and that the Taiwan Strait issue should be resolved peacefully. 
	
	
 Chien said the Republic of China government hopes that the United States will continue to play the role of "promoter, stabilizer and balancer" in cross-strait relations. 
	
	
 In his view, Chien went on, the main purpose of Bush's current Asia visit is to promote world peace and security. "Bush hopes to take advantage of his trip to forge a consensus with U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific area on his administration's fight against terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
	
	
 He said Bush is expected to discuss bilateral security cooperation, Japan's economic reforms and financial aid to Afghanistan in his talks with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. 
	
	
 During his trip to Seoul, Chien said, Bush is expected to exchange views with South Korean leaders on arms procurement and policies toward North Korea. 
	
	
 "As for the topics to be touched upon in Bush's talks with Beijing leaders, the agenda will include mainland China's agricultural market opening, religious freedom and human rights condition, missile shield and Taiwan Strait issues," Chien noted.	


	
BSE case reported in southwestern France 
	
	
 Text of report by French news agency AFP 
	
	
 Auch, 2 March (AFP): A fourth case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was recently confirmed in the Gers department [of southwestern France], the Gers prefecture announced on Saturday [2 March]. The animal concerned was a milk cow and the farm has not been named. In accordance with the new regulations which came into force last week, all the animals in the herd will be slaughtered except for those born after 1 January 2002, the prefecture said. The first two BSE cases in Gers were detected last August, and a third was confirmed at the end of January in a 6-year-old milk cow. 
	
	
	


	
NIZHNY NOVGOROD. March 22 (Interfax-AVN) -A habitual criminal who escaped from a convoy and started a shootout in the Perm region overnight to Friday has surrendered to the police, a spokesman for the main police department in the Volga federal district told Interfax-Military News Agency on Friday. Sergei Serdyuk, 32, was convicted several times on charges of theft, assault amd car hijacking. He was detained in March 2002 once again. While being transported to the police department of the Komi- Perm autonomous region on Thursday, Serdyuk escaped from a convoy of the Kochevo police department. The incident happened on the Perm-Kudymkar motorway 6km from the Karagai village of the Perm region at about midnight. Materials contained in the criminal case brought against Serdyuk say that the man disarmed the convoy, got hold of four PM pistols, wounded the head of the criminal investigation subdepartment of the Kochevo police department, who commanded the convoy, captured the driver of the police vehicle and left in the direction of Perm. The car was stopped near the Krasnokamsk village, the shootout started, and Serdyuk escaped in a forest. No casualties were registered among policemen. Two PM pistols were found at the site. Serdyuk surrendered to the police at 8:20 a.m. Moscow time (0520 GMT) on Friday. Arms were confiscated from him, the spokesman said. @ 2002 Interfax-Military News Agency, All rights reserved.

 Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA) -- Relations between Taiwan and the United States have increasingly become "harmonious and close" since U. S. President George W. Bush took office and Bush's current mainland visit is unlikely to affect the two-way ties, a presidential aide said Thursday. 
	
	
 Secretary-General of the Presidential Office Chen Shih-meng said the U. S. has repeatedly assured Taiwan that Bush will stick to his commitments to help protect Taiwan and he will not do or say anything that could damage Taiwan's interests while visiting mainland China. 
	
	
 According to Chen, the main purpose of Bush's mainland trip is to thank Beijing for its cooperation in the U.S.-led anti-terrorist war following last year's Sept. 11 terror attacks on Washington and New York. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, Chang Shiao-yue, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated that the United States had briefed Taiwan on Bush's mainland visit before his departure and made it clear that the trip would not hurt Taiwan's interests. She added the ministry has set up a task force to monitor developments and deal with all contingencies.

 Moscow, 9 November: Russia's Defence Ministry has denied Taleban assertions that Russian officers are serving in the Northern Alliance. "Formations of the anti-Taleban coalition do not include officers of the Russian armed forces," a high-ranking military official told Interfax on Friday. "Russia has provided only military-technical assistance to the Northern Alliance and continues to do so. Russian officers were not dispatched to Afghanistan either as unit leaders or as instructors," the official added. 
	
	
	


	
The federal and local authorities are currently preparing the ratification of the Kyoto international protocol on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases. Within the framework of that protocol, Belgium must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5 percent, compared to 1990, in the 2008-2012 period. Following the formal ratification of the Kyoto protocol by all the parliaments of the concerned countries, that protocol will become equivalent to a Belgian law. This implies -- whether or not one agrees with it -- that the Kyoto protocol will become binding for all of this country's inhabitants and institutions. 
	
	
 We readily accept that there are good intentions on the part of both the government and this country's various sectors to comply with the Kyoto standards. However, no broad social debate has yet been conducted on the crucial question: How much should each sector or target group contribute to achieving the Belgian Kyoto standard? Because this debate has failed to take place, it is understandable that all sectors (ranging from processing and manufacturing industrial sector, the electricity sector, the tertiary sector, and the transport sector to the residential sector) are currently doing their utmost to make their own future efforts as small (yet acceptable) as possible. 
	
	
 That is strikingly illustrated by Belgian large-scale industry, which has made great efforts over the past 10 years, over which energy intensity (energy use per unit of final product) has improved considerably. But a very considerable increase in production is expected in Belgium over the next 10 years, so that (even with very efficient processes) overall carbon dioxide emissions will certainly rise. Large-scale industry wishes to counter the expected rise with so-called benchmark covenants. 
	
	
 In a nutshell, benchmarking means that companies compare their energy efficiency with that of similar plants abroad. In these covenants, the companies pledge to rank among the world leaders in energy efficiency by 2012. In return for their commitment, they are exempted from additional (Flemish) emission restrictions, taxes on emissions, or negotiable emission rights. 
	
	
 Belgian industry is advocating benchmark covenants because it is afraid that an absolute limit would weaken considerably its competitive position with respect to similar companies in regions where the Kyoto protocol is not ratified. According to industry, relocation, with the resulting job losses, would be the only solution. However, this disregards the fact that arguments other than purely financial ones also play a part in the location decisions of companies in our region (favorable location near seaports, availability of know-how, well-educated personnel, stable political climate...). 
	
	
 Those covenants contain insufficient guarantees in themselves to achieve the Belgian/Flemish reduction targets in an economically efficient manner. 
	
	
 To begin with, the principle of benchmarking itself raises questions. If it were to emerge from the comparison with domestic and foreign companies that certain companies do not rank among the world leaders in energy efficiency, they would have to present a plan to achieve the highest energy efficiency on time (by 2012). But benchmarking is not sufficient from the viewpoint of economic efficiency (realizing the Kyoto restrictions on emissions at the lowest possible costs for the whole of society). 
	
	
 A cost-efficient division of efforts implies that each sector must limit its emissions to the point at which the additional costs for one extra ton of reduction are the same in all sectors. As a result, the costs of additional restrictions on emissions in industry must be compared with those of other sectors, such as the transport sector, households, the service sector, and so forth. Benchmarking guarantees only that companies belong to the top of their class, but says nothing about that class's performance as compared with the whole universe. 
	
	
 Second, benchmark covenants do not guarantee that the external climate costs of energy use (the increased greenhouse effect caused by the burning of fossil fuels) are correctly taken into account in the final products of the sectors concerned. However, taking into account these external climate costs is essential, because the users of energy-intensive goods are confronted in that way with the consequences of their choice of product. In that way, less energy-intensive products enjoy a relative advantage. 
	
	
 Third, questions can be asked about the emission restrictions that would be achieved by the covenants. Companies are urged in the proposed covenants to adopt measures which have an economic cost recovery period of less than five years or have an internal rate of return greater than that of a straight-lined obligation. But it is highly unclear whether these measures will lead to many extra reductions of emissions in comparison with the business as usual scenario without additional policy efforts. 
	
	
 Fourth is the contrast between the benchmark covenants' relative emissions standards and the Belgian Government's absolute restrictions on emissions within the framework of the Kyoto protocol. Since industry does not wish to let itself be pinned down on an absolute emissions ceiling, while the government feels itself committed to an absolute ceiling, industry is foisting the necessary efforts onto other sectors in society through the benchmark covenants. If industrial greenhouse gas emissions increase considerably over the next 10 years, that will have to be offset by a commensurate reduction of emissions in the transport sector, services, households, and so forth. 
	
	
 Thus the benchmark covenants could have very significant consequences for other sectors and target groups in our society, whereas the latter are not involved in the deliberations on those covenants. Hence a broad social debate on who should contribute how much to realizing the Kyoto standards is urgently necessary. 
	
	
 Despite these shortcomings, we believe that a role is reserved for the instrument of benchmark covenants. Thus the benchmark covenants could be reconciled with the European Commission's recent proposals for launching a unified market for European carbon dioxide emissions by 2005. This European proposal assumes absolute restrictions on emissions (companies obtain rights to emit a certain number of tons of carbon dioxide) and is hence irreconcilable at first sight with the Flemish benchmark covenants. However, the benchmark covenants could be opportune here for settling the initial allocation of emission rights. Companies could be allocated rights on the basis of an energy efficiency standard, on the condition that they are prepared to accept an absolute emissions ceiling. However, if they wish to emit more (because, for instance, their output is increasing considerably), they can do so provided that they purchase the necessary emission rights from companies which have a surplus of rights. 
	
	
 The great advantage of negotiable emission rights in that the system can lead to a cost-efficient division of effort among all sectors and target groups. By using the benchmark covenants to allocate emission rights initially, the good points of covenants are retained and their drawbacks are eliminated. 
	
	
 In any case, it is high time that a social debate be organized on the division of effort to achieve the Kyoto aims. Only a division that takes account of every sector's possibilities and is borne by the various target groups guarantees that Belgium will achieve its Kyoto aims without draconian measures having to be adopted at the eleventh hour. 
	
	
	


	
Mugabe must be confronted with constitution issue 
	
	
 Lovemore Madhuku 3/21/02 1:40:54 AM (GMT +2) 
	
	
 IT will be a monumental tragedy for Zimbabwe and the future of the democratisation process if we fail to draw proper and useful lessons from the debacle surrounding the just-concluded presidential election. I must warn at the outset that there are two groups of persons whose analyses must be handled with caution. The first group is the media. The second group is that of "winning" and "losing" politicians. 
	
	
 These two groups dominated the pre-election period with all sorts of analyses and predictions whose value is yet to be ascertained. 
	
	
 Yet I must declare my interests at the outset. From those very first days sometime in early 1997 when, alongside colleagues like Tendai Biti, Welshman Ncube, Brian Kagoro, Priscilla Misihairabwi, Everjoice Win and Tawanda Mutasa, I participated in formulating the concept of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), it has been clear to me that the sole purpose of the current Zimbabwean constitution is to preserve and protect the rule of ZANU PF. 
	
	
 My view then, and indeed those of my colleagues, was that a democratic environment in which free and fair elections are the norm, and in which citizens enjoy real freedoms, could only be created if a new, democratic and people-driven constitution were put in place. In terms of that view, it is almost impossible to change the government through an election conducted in terms of the current constitution. 
	
	
 This is the view I still hold so strongly that I must confess it may cloud my assessment of the just-concluded presidential elections. 
	
	
 There is little doubt that the presidential election was neither free nor fair. An election which fails to meet the standard of being "free and fair" produces an illegitimate outcome. 
	
	
 This much must be regarded as admitting of no doubt. However, this says nothing about the way forward. This election was not stolen on March 9 and 10 2002, nor is the outcome illegitimate merely on the allegations of rigging arising from the events of the polling days. 
	
	
 The lesson to be learnt from this poll is that until Zimbabwe has a genuinely democratic constitution enshrining universally recognised norms and institutions for the holding of an election, a free and fair ballot will remain a mirage. 
	
	
 Politicians who in the run-up to the election peddled theories about how the "will" of the people would prevail notwithstanding the labyrinth of constitutional provisions loaded against a free and fair election must now admit that they were wrong. Most of the problems faced in this election have their roots in the defective nature of our constitutional framework. I now proceed to illustrate this truth. 
	
	
 First, the voter registration process was not transparent and was conducted in such a way as to favour the ruling party. The main reason for this lack of transparency is that in terms of the current constitution and laws, voter registration is conducted by officials appointed by, and answerable to, the President. 
	
	
 In other countries, this process is handled by an Independent Electoral Commission which is an impartial body and whose independence is guaranteed by the constitution. In our case, the so-called "supplementary voters' roll" was nothing but a list of names of ZANU PF supporters compiled under dubious circumstances but it was given legal validity by President Robert Mugabe acting is terms of the current constitution and laws. 
	
	
 Secondly, the designation of polling stations, as is now well known, was specifically done in a way that favoured ZANU PF by granting ridiculously few polling stations in urban areas. This was done by officials appointed by, and answerable to, Mugabe. In other countries, this is done by an Independent Electoral Commission, which is constitutionally enjoined to act impartially. 
	
	
 Third, it is alleged that some key election officials such as presiding officers were Central Intelligence Organisation operatives. In other countries, there is no scope for such madness. An Independent Electoral Commission appoints professional election officials. 
	
	
 Fourth, there were the so-called "no-go areas" in Mashonaland Central, West, East and some parts of the Midlands. Parliament also passed the Public Order and Security Act which the police deliberately misinterpreted to suppress the opposition. 
	
	
 Our constitution does not specifically provide for political rights such as free and equal campaigning platforms for competing political parties. If such rights had been enshrined, it would have given the opposition the right to approach the courts for orders directing the police to facilitate free campaigning in the so-called no-go areas. 
	
	
 Fifth, equal access to the public media is not guaranteed by our constitution. This enabled the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation to abuse its position by broadcasting ZANU PF propaganda only. 
	
	
 Finally, and more significantly, the President enjoys enormous powers under the current constitution which he used to further his electoral chances. It was the President who directed that there be tripartite elections in Harare. And in doing this, he overrode court orders to the contrary. 
	
	
 The tripartite elections contributed to what ultimately became a "low" turnout in Harare. 
	
	
 After the Supreme Court nullified the General Laws Amendment Act, the President used his powers to reinstate most of its provisions through a statutory instrument. Thus, it was the President who banned postal voting by all Zimbabweans outside their constituencies except members of the army and the police. The latter are alleged to have voted for Mugabe. 
	
	
 The ban on monitoring of elections by civic society was also reinstated. There were other countless examples of the President's use of the powers he enjoys under the current constitution to mould the electoral process in his favour. 
	
	
 The conclusion to be reached from this whole picture is that under the current constitutional and legal framework for the holding of presidential elections, it is almost impossible to vote out an incumbent President. It was naive for the Movement for Democratic Change to believe that the people's anger against Mugabe was, in itself, sufficient to carry the day in an election, whatever the circumstances. 
	
	
 The issue is not about Mugabe. If Mugabe were to announce his retirement before the expiry of his six-year term and ZANU PF were to field any of his less illustrious colleagues as a presidential candidate, without a fundamental change to the rules, Zimbabweans will learn an even more bitter lesson: ZANU PF will "steal" that election again. 
	
	
 We do not need to wait for that scenario before we embrace the need to fight for a new constitution. We have learnt our lesson and it will be irresponsible to seek to dispute this clear fact. 
	
	
 This brings us to the way forward. Two points must be made. 
	
	
 First, there has been no spontaneous uprising against Mugabe notwithstanding the widespread disbelief that greeted his victory among many voters, particularly those in urban areas. ZANU PF had anticipated such an uprising, hence the massive intimidatory show of force that was evident in the deployment of security forces in every part of the country during and after the announcement of the election results. 
	
	
 Secondly, key African countries have accepted Mugabe's victory while almost the entire Western world has "rejected" the election results. These two points are crucial in any discussion of the way forward. 
	
	
 Various options have been discussed, but the better way forward is to confront the Mugabe regime with the constitutional question. Constitutional reform is at the heart of any new democratic discourse in Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 Mugabe must be forced to yield to a new process of constitutional reform leading to a new constitution. There must be mass action for a new constitution. 
	
	
 Mass action for a new constitution places Mugabe in a difficult situation. He cannot be heard to defend the current constitution, which has been roundly condemned by all. He has used the current constitution to stay in power. 
	
	
 Even the African observers who endorsed Mugabe's re-election have also criticised the constitutional framework governing elections in Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 More fundamentally, the struggle for a new constitution is a question of principle, not personalities. It is a legitimate struggle which Mugabe cannot dismiss as a Western imperialist ploy because its demands are clear and unambiguous: a more democratic system of government, a more democratic framework for conducting elections, an expanded Bill of Rights and so on. 
	
	
 Mugabe has no moral excuse for shooting people merely demanding a new constitution. 
	
	
 The masses required for such a struggle to succeed need not be substantial. This struggle does not need a spontaneous uprising. A core of determined and committed Zimbabweans is sufficient for this purpose. 
	
	
 It is critical that a new constitution be in place as soon as possible so that any future election is held in a transparent and credible manner. 
	
	
 A presidential election is not necessarily six years away. Under the current constitution, the President has no powers to designate a successor, should he decide to retire. A fresh election must be held within 90 days. 
	
	
 The same situation arises if the President dies while in office. Never again should Zimbabweans go into an election under the current constitution. 
	
	
 A criticism which has been levelled against this way forward is that mass action aimed at confronting Mugabe with a demand for a new constitution translates into recognising him when in fact his government is illegitimate. This is useless sophistry. 
	
	
 Mugabe is a political fact. In legal jargon, to those who do not recognise his presidency, he remains the de facto President. It is him who must be confronted with such a demand as constitutional reform. 
	
	
 The NCA last December completed a draft constitution which Mugabe, through Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa, refused to receive. That draft must be forced on Mugabe and the NCA hopes that Zimbabweans will join in this noble cause to put in place a secure framework for good governance in Zimbabwe.

MOSCOW. Feb 21 (Interfax) - Russia's Interior Ministry is looking into a report about Russian entrepreneur Viktor Bout's involvement in arms supplies to the al-Qaeda terrorist organization. 
	
	
 "Deputy Interior Minister Nikolai Bobrovsky ordered a detailed probe and verification of this information," Interior Ministry spokesman Yuri Shuvalov told Interfax on Thursday.	


	
HONG KONG, March 26 (AFP) - China has disallowed a routine port call in Hong Kong for an American naval vessel, a spokeswoman for the US consulate said Tuesday. 
	
	
 "The Chinese government denied a requested visit by the USS Curtis Wilbur, a destroyer, to visit Hong Kong from April 5 to 9," she said adding, "this would have been a routine port call." 
	
	
 "No reason was given for the disapproval," the spokeswoman added. 
	
	
 The bar on the USS Curtis Wilbur with some 346 crew is seen as reflecting Beijing's anger over Washington's decision to allow Taiwanese Defense Minister Tang Yao-ming to visit Florida for a military conference this month. 
	
	
 Beijing has twice summoned the US ambassador for dressings down over the issue, while a state-controlled newspaper reported last week that China was preparing to cancel naval exchanges with the United States in retaliation. 
	
	
 The last time such a request was turned down was in May last year following the collision of a US spy plane with a Chinese fighter jet in international air space over the South China Sea on April 1, 2001. 
	
	
 However, US naval visits to Hong Kong resumed in July. 
	
	
 There were two other similar episodes of permission being denied before that since the 1997 handover of the former British colony to China. 
	
	
 One of them was after the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia was bombed, killing three people, in the US-led NATO air campaign three years ago. 
	
	
 When Hong Kong was under British rule, the US navy made up to 65 port calls a year and Beijing had agreed the stopovers would continue after the territory returned to Chinese sovereignty. 
	
	
	


	
STATE VISIT: The US president is getting good reviews from political experts for refusing to restate the `three nos' and declining to endorse peaceful reunification 
	
	
 As US President George W. Bush wrapped up his six-day visit to Asia yesterday, analysts gave their thumbs up to his determination to voice his firm support for Taiwan despite pressure from China to do otherwise. 
	
	
 "We felt gratified and relieved after watching Bush stick to his principles on the issue of Taiwan. He did not make any concessions, even after his meetings with the Chinese leaders in Beijing," said Cheng Tuan-yao, research fellow at the Institute of International Relations in National Chengchi University. 
	
	
 While past trips to China by US presidents have produced agreements or statements that have damaged Taiwan's interests, Bush's visit only enhanced the nation's confidence in his administration, Cheng said. 
	
	
 "Bush has made the first correct step by spurning his predecessor's appeasement of China. Notably, he didn't restate the so-called `three nos' policy," said DPP legislator Parris Chang (Chang Hsu-ch'eng) of Bush's remarks on Taiwan during his two-day trip to Beijing that concluded yesterday afternoon. 
	
	
 Former US president Bill Clinton agitated Taiwan when he gave the so-called "three nos" speech during his visit to China in 1998. The "three nos" include no support for an independent Taiwan; no recognition of "two Chinas'' or one China and a separate Taiwan; and no support for Taiwan's entry into international organizations that require members to be states. 
	
	
 "Bush has been very forthcoming in stating the US commitment to defend Taiwan against the possible use of force by China," said Chang, a specialist in international relations. 
	
	
 Bush reitered his desire for a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue several times during his trip to Beijing. The US president also declined to endorse China's version of a "peaceful unification" between Taiwan and China, reflecting the longstanding US position on cross-strait relations, analysts said. 
	
	
 "Of course he would not use the term of `peaceful reunification' ... because the American position is that relations between Taiwan and China should be open-ended," Chang said. 
	
	
 "The three communiques have not committed the US to peaceful reunification," he added. 
	
	
 China's Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, in a speech in Washington earlier this month, urged the US to support "peaceful unification." 
	
	
 But Bush's refusal to respond to a similar push by a student yesterday during the question-and-answer session of his talk at Tsinghua University showed that the US president stuck to the US existing policy, according to analysts. 
	
	
 Cheng pointed out what he saw as the implications of Bush's remarks on missile defense. 
	
	
 "Bush said any missile-defense system was to protect friends and allies of the US from countries with massive destructive capabilities. Although he did not mention Taiwan directly, the implication of this remark seemed to be that Taiwan was not to be excluded," Cheng said. 
	
	
 Bush described Taiwan as a "good friend" of the US during his weekly radio address to the US public that aired last week within hours of his departure for Asia. 
	
	
 Bush's mention several times of the Taiwan Relations Act, the 1979 US law that pledged that the US would supply Taiwan with the defensive weapons it needed to fend off a Chinese attack, also reflected his firm support for Taiwan, analysts said. 
	
	
 China has tried to highlight and accentuate the Taiwan issue during Bush's trip to China, but the US agenda rested instead on anti-terrorism and China's proliferation of arms sale to countries like Iran and Pakistan, Chang argued. 
	
	
 But as Bush concluded his trip to Asia yesterday, it was clear that China failed to elicit from him a statement on the "three nos" and on opposition to Taiwanese independence, Chang said. 
	
	
 The US' rising concerns over China's military expansion and its appreciation for Taipei's support for the US-led war against terrorism drove Bush to stand firm in his support for Taiwan, the DPP legislator said. 
	
	
 The Pentagon's quadrennial defense review issued last September -- which highlighted the rising Chinese threat -- and the recent testimony by the CIA director to the US Senate on China's military modernization were indicative of the Bush administration's perception of China as a growing threat to US national security. 
	
	
 "These two reports seemed to indicate that the Bush administration took China's rising military threat more seriously than did the Clinton's administration. And therefore, the US is much more forthcoming in voicing its support for Taiwan," Chang said. 
	
	
 Fresh from his trip to Washington, where US government officials highlighted Taiwan's contribution to the war against terrorism, Chang said, "Even as a small country, we stood with the US at that critical moment, and the US appreciated that and has reciprocated what we've done."	


	
Settlers Have Taken Palestine Hostage 
	
	
 A few days ago the parties in the Palestine conflict found themselves at a crossroads. The escalation of the conflict has now cost over 1,000 people their lives in the space of the past 18 months. 
	
	
 One-third Israelis, two-thirds Palestinians. Circumstances have led to a situation where today the two parties in the conflict find themselves on the road that leads swiftly to the abyss. 
	
	
 On Thursday the Arab Summit in the Lebanese capital of Beirut ended with the adoption of a resolution whose content illustrated how far the Arab world has come since the summit that took place in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum in 1967, shortly after the Israeli victory in the Six Days War. 
	
	
 It was then that the Arab heads of state adopted the three noes: no to negotiations with Israel, no to recognition, no to peace. 
	
	
 On Thursday the summit adopted a resolution that proposed the recognition of the Jewish state, normal relations, and an end to the conflict in return for Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories that Israel has occupied for almost 35 years. 
	
	
 Even the mention of one of the cardinal problems between Israel and the Palestinians - the future of the 3 million Arab refugees - was couched in terms softer than at any time in the past. 
	
	
 The summit's declaration was the best piece of news the Middle East has produced since the Oslo Accords between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat were signed on the lawn in front of the White House in Washington in 1993. 
	
	
 The resolution that was put forward by Saudi Arabia was a plea addressed to the Israeli people over the heads of Ariel Sharon's government. No Arab leader was in any doubt that from Sharon's standpoint the resolution was not welcome. 
	
	
 The resolution forced him into a corner. Sharon neither can nor will give up the occupied territories, and so he would be unmasked in the eyes of the whole world as the man standing in the way of peace in the Middle East. 
	
	
 A few hours after the end of the summit chance came to Sharon's rescue. 
	
	
 On Thursday evening a Palestinian suicide bomber attacked a hotel in Natanya where a couple of hundred people had gathered for the traditional Passover meal. Twenty-two people were killed, in addition to the suicide bomber, and 130 were injured. 
	
	
 The bomber was a member of Hamas, the radical Muslim organization. He was known to the Israeli intelligence service. His name figured on a list that Israel had shortly before handed over to the Palestinian security service. 
	
	
 Despite Arafat's promise to take action to neutralize the people on the list, he did not lift a finger. 
	
	
 That same night the Israeli security cabinet met. They decided to take steps to destroy the "Palestinian terrorist structure, arrest its leaders, confiscate arms, and so on." 
	
	
 As a first step Israeli forces were sent into the main Palestinian town, Ramallah, where Arafat has his headquarters and from where the autonomous Palestinian areas are administered. 
	
	
 A few weeks previously Sharon had described Arafat as "irrelevant." Now he declared that Arafat was an "enemy." 
	
	
 He is now a prisoner in his own headquarters. The Palestinian Authority has effectively ceased to function. 
	
	
 Prior to the Natanya massacre Washington had imposed a number of limitations on Sharon. Israeli's antiterrorist operations must not bring the Palestinian Authority to collapse, Israeli forces must not reconquer the territories under the jurisdiction of the authority, and Arafat the man must not be molested. 
	
	
 This time Washington is largely keeping silent. It has not sent the usual appeals to both sides. Quite the reverse: Anonymous U.S. sources say that Washington holds Arafat responsible for the fact that U.S. mediator Anthony Zinni's endeavors to arrange a cease-fire have now foundered. 
	
	
 According to these sources, Sharon had accepted the cease-fire proposal, while Arafat hesitated. Before he had announced his agreement, the Natanya massacre and the Israeli counteraction occurred. 
	
	
 For the time being at least the United States has thus given Sharon a free hand. His problem is that he does not know what to do with it. The action that is currently taking place can at best only throw the terrorist groups off balance for a time. 
	
	
 It cannot solve the Israeli people's security problems, because the root of the terrorism is the Israeli occupation and the Israeli settlements on occupied territory. 
	
	
 The settlers, who number around 220,000 people, have taken the Israeli Government and consequently both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples hostage. 
	
	
 Sharon is a master of escalation. He demonstrated this he as defense minister during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which led to Arafat's being forced into exile in Tunis. It is likely that at present Sharon is entertaining similar thoughts and wants to create step by step a situation that will make it possible for him to rid himself of his enemy. 
	
	
 But this is a conflict without winners. Military superiority cannot solve problems that are fundamentally of a political nature. The day the Israeli tanks again leave Ramallah they will have sown the seed for new terrorist actions. 
	
	
 Terrorism thrives in an atmosphere of hate, and the Israeli occupation and the use of military force are creating the fertile soil from which future terrorists will be recruited.
