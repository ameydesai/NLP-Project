   US-Japan climate talks end

 



  Representatives from Japan and the United States have finished 
two days of talks Tuesday on climate change in Tokyo.

  They discussed ways of co-operating in the science and 
technology fields to prevent global warming.

  The meeting was the first between the two countries since 
President George Bush unveiled a new US plan calling for 
voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic 
growth rather than mandatory targets.

  At the start of the meeting, the US said it would promote 
research and development into climate change.

  
Japan says it still intends to ratify the Kyoto protocol.

  President Bush caused an international outcry when he rejected 
the 1997 Kyoto protocol on climate change last year, saying it 
hindered US economic growth.

Zimbabwe's rigged election

 



  The election this week in Zimbabwe was an ugly travesty from 
which all of southern Africa will suffer. Voters lined up for 
hours at polling stations, many of them in vain. Supporters of 
the main opposition candidate were intimidated and beaten. Then 
the long-serving, increasingly tyrannical president, Robert 
Mugabe, was declared the winner. International observers called 
the process deeply flawed, and the Bush administration has 
refused to recognize the declared results.

  Unfortunately, some leading African countries like South Africa 
and Nigeria have compounded the problem by accepting Mugabe's 
victory despite earlier assertions that they would not recognize 
the results of a rigged election. By failing to hold firm they 
not only damage their diplomatic credibility, but also ignore 
the consequences for nearby African states of Mugabe's misrule. 
These include explosive political frustration, a swelling tide 
of desperate refugees and a growing reluctance by foreign 
companies and donors to invest in the region. Washington and 
other Western governments may now strengthen the current mild 
sanctions against Zimbabwe. These steps would be far more 
effective if they were joined by major African states.

  Mugabe, who led Zimbabwe's liberation struggle against white 
minority rule in the late 1970's, has systematically wrecked his 
country's economy and its freedoms to prolong his 22-year-old 
hold on power. Zimbabwe should be an economic beacon, not a 
basket case. It is blessed with fertile agricultural land, and 
during the first dozen years of Mugabe's rule it was relatively 
prosperous and free.

  That picture changed radically in the mid-1990's when Mugabe 
shifted onto a highly destructive course. He incited violent 
land seizures that have taken a disastrous toll on agricultural 
investment and production and launched a broad assault on 
journalistic freedom and judicial independence. This campaign 
has been carried out with help from a small but loyal core of 
former liberation fighters turned thugs. Thugs and fraud cannot 
keep the 78-year-old Mugabe in power forever. Zimbabwe's 
recovery will have to wait for his departure.

Mugabe Wins Despite Biased Propaganda

 



  
TEHRAN TIMES INTL. DESK

  TEHRAN -- President Robert Mugabe easily won Zimbabwe's election 
on Wednesday despite biased propaganda unleashed against him by 
some Western countries, accusing him of being unfair towards the 
opposition.

  Results announced by Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede at 0800 
GMT showed Mugabe with 1,634,382 votes, well past the 50 percent 
of ballots cast that he needed to extend his 22-year rule for 
six more year.

  His challenger, former trade unionist Morgan Tsvangirai, trailed 
almost half a million votes behind. Mudede said 3.1 million 
people voted in the three-day election.

  There were fears of a violent reaction from Tsvangirai's 
supporters, and security forces were put on high alert and 
police put up road blocks on approach roads to the capital 
Harare.

  Australia said it feared violence if voters thought the election 
had been stolen. Canberra is a member of a Three-Nation 
Commonwealth task force monitoring the election.

  Tsvangirai, saying Mugabe has destroyed the economy of the once 
prosperous nation, accused the president of systematically 
stealing the election to hide his deep unpopularity with voters, 
Reuters reported.

  Mugabe's government has dismissed criticism of the poll, which 
Information Minister Jonathan Moyo called "exemplary".

  Western countries queued up to condemn the election in which the 
78-year-old president faced his first real challenge.

  The United States, condemning the reduction of polling stations 
in opposition urban strongholds, said the election was 
"seriously flawed" and riddled with irregularities.

  Australia and Britain led an unsuccessful call for commonwealth 
sanctions against Mugabe before the election.

  New Zealand said on Wednesday it was ready to impose sanctions 
against Zimbabwe if the commonwealth decided not to suspend the 
country after the vote.




Many fear violence after Zimbabwe vote

 



  HARARE, Zimbabwe Wellington Chinyama sat down in a barber's 
chair, unfolded his newspaper and without glancing up asked the 
young man trimming his hair the question that seems to be on 
virtually everyone's mind here: "So Joseph, have you prepared 
yourself for Zimbabwe's civil war?"

  As Zimbabweans go to the polls this weekend to re-elect or oust 
Robert Mugabe, the only leader the country has ever known, the 
question of who will win the election seems almost secondary to 
how the loser and his followers will respond.

  Surveys show the challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, a trade union 
leader, ahead of Mugabe. But a surge in political violence and 
accusations that the governing party changed election laws to 
rig the vote have fanned widespread concerns among Zimbabweans, 
election monitors and foreign diplomats that neither political 
party nor their supporters are prepared to accept the final 
tally.

  "It does not take a vivid imagination to envision a scenario on 
the ground where either rioters or the military take to the 
streets in the days to come," an African diplomat said.

  Most disturbing are pronouncements by senior government 
officials and military leaders that they would not allow this 
former British colony to be led by Tsvangirai and his political 
party, the Movement for Democratic Change. In a television 
interview broadcast the other day, Didymus Mutasa, a spokesman 
for Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party, said that he and other 
veterans of the country's independence war found the prospect of 
a Tsvangirai government intolerable.

  "People have said being ruled by the MDC is being ruled by Ian 
Smith," Mutasa said, referring to the prime minister of 
white-ruled Rhodesia, as the country was known before gaining 
independence in 1980. "Under these circumstances, if there were 
to be a coup, we would support it very definitely."

  At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, 
almost all of them supporters of the Movement for Democratic 
Change. State Department officials this week accused Mugabe's 
government of numerous human rights violations during the 
election campaign, an allegation vehemently denied by ZANU-PF 
officials.

  A newspaper reported that Mugabe had put the armed forces on 
"high alert" and had recalled soldiers from neighboring Congo, 
where they have been deployed in that country's civil war. 
Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri denied the reports.

  Many Zimbabweans see this weekend's election as a contest 
between immovable forces: a 78-year-old autocrat desperate to 
remain in power and an opposition party dominated by restless 
young citizens weary of government corruption, food shortages 
and unemployment.

  "If Mugabe announces that he has won the election, I think that 
people will not believe it and will storm the castle," said 
Sibongile Mbuyiso, an opposition supporter. "But if the MDC 
wins, I believe Mugabe will announce martial law, throw 
Tsvangirai in jail for plotting to kill him and send the army 
into the streets."

  Government officials last month charged Tsvangirai and two other 
officials of his party with high treason for allegedly plotting 
to assassinate Mugabe. That charge is based largely on a heavily 
edited videotape in which Tsvangirai refers to the "elimination" 
of Mugabe.

  Tsvangirai was responding to a question posed by a Canadian 
publicist with whom he was meeting and who subsequently signed a 
contract with ZANU-PF. Political analysts say the charges may 
have laid the groundwork for Mugabe to jail Tsvangirai as a 
last-ditch effort to stay in power should he lose the election.

  But that outcome is certainly not a foregone conclusion. 
Opposition officials say that 22 of their polling agents have 
been abducted in the past week, and a surge in violent attacks 
in swing districts could persuade enough opposition supporters 
to vote for ZANU-PF to ensure Mugabe's victory.

  In addition, governing party officials have revised election 
laws and procedures in a manner that could change the outcome of 
the vote, according to independent election observers.

  ZANU-PF officials have told election observers that they intend 
to increase the number of polling stations in rural areas 
believed to be their strongholds and reduce the number of 
stations in urban areas, where there is strong support for the 
opposition. Observers say that could produce long voting lines 
and discourage some Tsvangirai supporters from casting ballots.

  ZANU-PF election officials also plan to use civil service 
employees to monitor the vote-counting and bar independent 
monitors from nonprofit organizations from assisting in such 
routine tasks as transporting ballot boxes to counting stations. 
A residency requirement introduced last month bans registered 
voters from casting ballots if they cannot provide leases or 
utility bills in their names. That, according to foreign 
diplomats and Tsvangirai supporters, could disenfranchise 
hundreds of thousands of young opposition supporters who live 
with their parents.

  "Clearly, Mugabe is doing everything he can to steal this 
election," said John Makumbe, a political science professor at 
the University of Zimbabwe.

  Tsvangirai said at a news conference Thursday night that if he 
won the election, he would not prosecute Mugabe. That could ease 
pressure on Mugabe to remain in power to avoid prosecution for 
his government's attack in the 1980s in Matabeleland, the home 
of the Ndebele tribe, which at the time posed the most 
significant threat to his leadership. An estimate of the number 
of people killed in the operation ranges from 10,000 to 20,000.

   Harsh detention for Afghan prisoners

 



  Taleban and al-Qaeda prisoners flown from Afghanistan to an 
American naval base in the Caribbean are being held in tough 
conditions of detention.

  A temporary detention centre called Camp X-Ray has been set up 
at the base in Guantanamo Bay, an isolated US outpost on the 
edge of Fidel Castro's Cuba.

  The prisoners are being housed in cells measuring 1.8 by 2.4 
metres (six feet by eight feet) with open, chain-link walls, a 
concrete floor and wooden roof.

  They face intense interrogation by US officials anxious to track 
down Osama Bin Laden, the alleged mastermind behind the 11 
September suicide attacks on New York and Washington.

  The US authorities have not granted the detainees 
prisoner-of-war status, meaning they are not protected by the 
Geneva Convention.

  Washington wants military tribunals to try the prisoners, and 
the cases are expected to be heard outside the US.

  As the base is located outside sovereign territory, the 
prisoners have no legal rights under the US constitution, and no 
right of appeal to federal courts.

  
'Are they kennels?'

  Jeffrey Kofman, an American journalist who has visited the base, 
said the facility was "very, very minimal".

  The cells had concrete floors, wooden roofs and wire mesh walls. 
Prisoners had a foam mat to sleep on, two towels - one for 
washing, the other to use as a prayer mat - and some form of 
chamber pot, he said.

  "It was a far more bares bones facility than frankly I expected 
to see. They say they will be holding the detainees in cells, 
but really they are cages...

  "One person said: 'Are they kennels?', to which one of the 
military staff in charge said: 'No they're not kennels, they are 
cells, and they're within the bounds of the Geneva Convention. 
What we are operating is humane treatment, but we're not 
offering comfort'."

  
International concern

  The human rights group Amnesty International voiced concern 
about the "cages" used for accommodation, saying they would 
"fall below minimum standards for humane treatment".

  The first group to arrive - 20 prisoners described by US 
military officials as "the worst elements of al-Qaeda and the 
Taleban" - wore goggles covered with tape and had their hands 
tied. Some also wore leg shackles.

  They wore surgical masks as some prisoners had tested positive 
for tuberculosis and at least one prisoner was sedated.

  They will spend most of their time separated, although they will 
be allowed out of their cells in small groups for meals, showers 
and some recreation.

  
They will be allowed to pray according to their faith.

  
Mosquitoes

  The camp gets chilly at night and there are swarms of 
mosquitoes.

  The base - known by US servicemen as "Gitmo"- is surrounded by 
mangrove swamps, salt marshes and dense bush - and the sea is 
shark-infested.

  The camp perimeters - lit up at night - has watchtowers and two 
fences topped with razor wire constantly patrolled by heavily 
armed marines.

  
At night the camp is lit up with halogen floodlights.

  Members of a movement that tried to prevent women working may be 
disconcerted to find that some of their guards are women.

  "We have no intention of making it comfortable," Marine 
Brigadier-General Michael Lehnert told Reuters news agency. "It 
will be humane."

  Hundreds of marines and military police have been flown to 
Guantanamo Bay to expand the compound to house up to 2,000 
prisoners.

  American marines landed in Guantanamo during the 
Spanish-American war in 1898, and the base was established under 
a 1903 treaty.

  After Fidel Castro led the Communists to power in Cuba in 1959, 
then US President Dwight Eisenhower refused to relinquish the 
base despite strong objections from Havana.

  Although Washington continues to pay the rent - set 100 years 
ago at 2,000 gold coins a year, and now worth about $4,000 - Mr 
Castro refuses to cash the cheques.

  Cuban Frontier Battalion troops continue to watch their US 
counterparts along the 28-kilometre fence, but tension has 
diminished since the end of the Cold War.

  
Hunt continues

  American officials have named al-Qaeda and Taleban leaders 
killed or captured as frustration grows that some senior Taleban 
figures are reportedly slipping through the net.

  Among those who have not been questioned by the US military are 
three former Taleban ministers who turned themselves into the 
new Afghan authorities - only to be allowed to return to their 
homes.

  The most important is former Justice Minister Mullah Nuruddin 
Turabi - known to be close to Taleban leader Mullah Omar - 
former Defence Minister Mullah Ubaidullah and former Industry 
Minister Mullah Saadudin.

  US officials are eager to question the three, who they believe 
may have vital clues about the whereabouts of Mullah Omar and 
Osama Bin Laden.

  The hunt continues for Bin Laden himself and Mullah Omar, who is 
believed to have escaped by motorbike as thousands of Afghan 
soldiers closed in on his suspected hideout.

  Also on the wanted list are many more of Bin Laden's top 
lieutenants who are believed to have evaded capture. They 
include Ayman al-Zawahri, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad leader who 
is Bin Laden's close adviser and personal doctor.

Bush's Policy on Argentina Signals Shift in Approach

 



  WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 - Seven years ago this month, President Bill 
Clinton's economic advisers told him Mexico was hours away from 
economic default and perhaps chaos on the streets. Mr. Clinton 
ordered an unpopular multibillion-dollar bailout, over the 
objections of Congress, but with the support of a prominent 
Republican governor, George W. Bush of Texas.

  When Argentina barreled toward a similar default in recent 
weeks, it was Mr. Bush who had to make the bailout call - and 
his decision was to let Argentina suffer the consequences of its 
own economic mismanagement. His aides argue that the 
circumstances were somewhat different: Mexico appeared ready to 
make reforms but needed time and cash, while Argentina had not 
heeded repeated warnings that its policies were leading to 
financial disaster.

  Still, Mr. Bush's reaction to the biggest international economic 
crisis so far in his presidency is a telling example of a new - 
and perhaps risky - approach to the kind of national economic 
bankruptcies that dominated Washington's dealings with the 
world's emerging markets in the late 1990's.

  The Clinton administration, fearing "economic contagion," was 
willing to back loans to teetering governments in Thailand, 
Indonesia, South Korea and Russia. But Mr. Bush's aides have 
adopted a policy some call "tough love," meant to reverse the 
expectation in capitals around the world that if you are big 
enough, or strategically important, Washington will always find 
a way to prevent fiscal and political collapse.

  Mr. Bush promised just such a policy during his presidential 
campaign. But the first time his approach was tested, when 
Turkey ran into deep trouble last spring, Mr. Bush's national 
security aides warned that it was no time to abandon a 
well-located ally whose government seemed willing to take the 
medicine the International Monetary Fund prescribed. Washington 
joined in the bailout.

  "It's fair to say," one senior administration official noted 
during the last week, "that while we have been clear, we haven't 
always been consistent."

  The hard line on Argentina, White House and Treasury officials 
say, was calculated to send the message that under the Bush 
administration, the United States would be a reluctant financial 
firefighter and that the markets should not bet on a bailout. It 
is a message that Mr. Bush's aides said in interviews this week 
that they hoped would force officials of developing countries 
and foreign investors to work out their problems without relying 
as much on huge aid packages from the International Monetary 
Fund and from Washington, which became commonplace after Mexico.

  "It is a different approach, but we needed a different 
approach," said John B. Taylor, undersecretary of the Treasury 
for international affairs. "We want to follow a policy that does 
not bail out bondholders and improves the market over all."

  
There are other new aspects to the Bush policy.

  Treasury officials in the Clinton era never shied away from 
dispensing a steady stream of advice to countries on the 
condition that they would have to meet to get Western aid. In 
contrast, during the Argentina crisis, Treasury Secretary Paul 
H. O'Neill was nearly invisible, rarely commenting on the 
country's approaching default, or the violent protests that led 
to the resignation of President Fernando de la R?  Officials say Mr. O'Neill supported the decision by the I.M.F. 
to cut off Argentina's loans because it had failed to meet the 
fund's demands for fiscal restraint. And now Washington's 
message to Argentina's new president, Eduardo Duhalde, is 
straightforward: Come up with a workable plan, and then we will 
talk.

  "President Bush never talked about specific steps he expected 
the Argentine government to take," said one White House official 
familiar with Mr. Bush's periodic calls and letters to Mr. de la 
R?d the series of his successors in recent weeks. "You won't 
find this administration having those kinds of conversations. 
Argentina has to come up with what works for them, and if we can 
support it, we will."

  Mr. Bush's approach carries considerable risk. There is every 
possibility that Argentina's new government will abandon the 
free-market leanings, tight fiscal and banking controls the 
country embraced with strong International Monetary Fund support 
over the last decade. Already there is considerable doubt that 
Argentina will now agree to the kind of hemispheric free-trade 
agreement that Mr. Bush himself, with Mr. de la R? his side, 
said last year was a major goal of his administration.

  Both the I.M.F. and the United States, the fund's largest 
shareholder, have come under some sharp criticism for denying 
new loans to Argentina after previously approving aid to the 
country. The last emergency loan was put together in August, 
with Mr. O'Neill's close supervision.

  The critics of Mr. Bush's decision to pull the plug on aid argue 
that the I.M.F. and the Bush administration were callous for 
abandoning an ally at a sensitive moment. And some argue that 
both the Clinton and Bush administrations should have acted 
sooner to steer Argentina away from its doomed efforts to defend 
a 1-to-1 peg of its peso to the dollar.

  But administration and I.M.F. officials respond that they aided 
Argentina for as long as they thought there was a reasonable 
chance that its political leaders were serious about reform. 
They pulled the plug, one senior administration official said, 
"only when it became clear that the collapse was going to happen 
sooner or later, and there was no use spending billions to get a 
few more weeks before the inevitable happened."

  Some longtime critics of the fund applauded the Bush 
administration's stance. Both left-wing anti-globalization 
activists and some conservative economists have argued that the 
fund became too interventionist during the Clinton years. That 
allowed investors to make reckless bets on the assumption that 
lending agencies would rescue them when things went wrong.

  "I am hopeful that we're in transition to a world in which 
countries and lenders learn more about risk," said Allan H. 
Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University, who headed a 
Congressional panel two years ago that advocated sweeping 
changes at the I.M.F. and the World Bank. "You can't just keep 
throwing money at these problems and hope they will go away."

Argentina's Chaos Raises New Doubts on Monetary Fund

 



  WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 - The deadly riots in Argentina, the 
collapse of its government and another multibillion dollar 
bailout gone awry have raised fresh questions about the 
effectiveness of the International Monetary Fund and the 
financial policies of the United States, the fund's leading 
shareholder.

  Latin American and European government leaders today joined 
protesters in Buenos Aires, Wall Street traders and financial 
experts in putting at least part of the blame for Argentina's 
problems on the lending agency and the Clinton and Bush 
administrations.

  Some say the monetary fund showed callousness by failing to give 
new aid to Argentina early this month, as the country's economic 
program, designed with I.M.F. approval, was forcing painful 
austerity measures on its citizens. Others say the fund made the 
opposite mistake, repeatedly offering loans to Argentina despite 
indications that the country's policies had become unworkable, 
delaying the day of reckoning.

  These criticisms, even if contradictory, increase pressure on 
the I.M.F. and the Bush administration to articulate a clear 
policy toward financial rescue efforts, which often come under 
fire even when they are judged successful.

  Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill came into office publicly 
denouncing multibillion dollar bailouts, saying that either they 
fail outright or they allow foreign governments to get away with 
bad policymaking and investors to get away with bad bets.

  In practice, however, the Bush administration has yet to take a 
clear stance on such bailouts and has made international 
financial policy a low priority.

  Peru's finance minister, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, complained today 
that the fund bungled its dealings with Argentina by adopting 
inconsistent policies that were at turns passive and inflexible. 
"The fund is partly to blame for this because the fund did not 
sound the alarm in time and then took a very hard line when 
things were incredibly difficult," he told Peruvian radio.

  Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister, assailed the I.M.F. 
for abandoning a longtime client and imposing "demands that have 
been excessive or at the wrong time." The French, who like the 
United States are significant fund shareholders, have called on 
the lending agency to step up its involvement to help Argentina 
recover.

  After some hand-wringing about jeopardizing the money of 
American "plumbers and carpenters," Mr. O'Neill supported a 
multibillion loan for Argentina in August. He has also backed 
two large rescue packages for Turkey, a strategic ally that has 
faced tough financial problems.

  When Argentina's crisis worsened in recent weeks, Bush 
administration officials did not take a firm position, allowing 
the I.M.F. to make the call on withholding additional loans, 
people involved in the fund's deliberations said.

  Even the harshest critics of the I.M.F. put most of the blame 
for Argentina's current plight on a succession of governments in 
Buenos Aires. But many say the monetary fund should have called 
government officials to account sooner.

  Argentina adopted a strict fixed- currency regime and overhauled 
its banks in the early 1990's. It tamed inflation and became, 
for a spell, a glowing economic success story.

  But subsequent governments allowed spending to grow out of 
control, building up a foreign debt that became impossible to 
maintain. Argentina also fell into a deep recession four years 
ago. The government beseeched the I.M.F. for help to stay 
solvent as it tried to work through its problems.

  Backed by both the Clinton and Bush administrations, the I.M.F. 
twice came to the rescue, beginning late last year.

  The idea was to help the country defend its fixed currency, 
which had become a political touchstone, while avoiding default 
on $132 billion in foreign debt, allowing it to continue good 
relations with foreign investors.

  The terms of the aid program were wrenching. The government 
agreed to slash spending during a deep recession to increase the 
chances of making debt payments on schedule.

  "If Argentina got its core economic policies right, it would 
have avoided this problem," said Charles Calomiris, a finance 
and economics professor at Columbia University who has been 
sounding the alarm about Argentina for months. "But the I.M.F. 
and both the Clinton and Bush administrations let them stay in 
denial. They all wanted the problem to fall on someone else's 
watch."

  It is always a tough call to cut off aid, Mr. Calomiris said. 
But he argued that by delaying, the fund helped Argentina dig 
itself into a deeper hole.

  "If you do not show leadership and make it happen early, then 
you face a catastrophe," he said.

  Michael Mussa, the I.M.F.'s chief economist until last spring, 
said the fund was justified in providing aid to Argentina late 
last year.

  But he said that he disagreed with the decision by the fund and 
the Bush administration to continue the aid program in August, 
when he said the situation in Argentina had likely deteriorated 
beyond repair.

  "The fund made a mistake in not saying no in August," Mr. Mussa 
said. "The situation might have been more controllable then."

  The difficulty, of course, is that such calls are much easier to 
make in hindsight. Mr. Mussa acknowledged that even when the 
political and economic situation in Argentina was more stable, a 
move to delay debt payments or devalue the currency ran the risk 
of rattling financial markets and even causing a financial 
implosion in the region.

  In contrast, by watching Argentina wrestle with its finances 
over a period of months, financial markets anticipated the 
possibility of a default. The chances of contagion are now 
viewed as minimal.

  Moreover, it is difficult to place blame for Argentina's 
economic program squarely on the fund when much of the policy 
was designed by Argentina itself, sometimes over the objections 
of the fund's economists.

  At an August meeting at I.M.F. headquarters, fund officials told 
Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, that the country 
would be better off delaying debt payments.

  Argentina, however, was determined to pay its debts in full and 
keep its fixed currency in place, fulfilling what it viewed as a 
promise to its citizens and creditors who had been told for 
years that pesos were as good as dollars. It outlined strict 
fiscal policies that it claimed would allow it to meet its 
obligations.

  But by December, as Mr. Cavallo resorted to freezing bank 
accounts and raiding pension funds to find enough hard currency 
to make debt payments, collapse looked imminent. The fund 
decided to suspend aid for a program that appeared to have 
little chance of success.

  Though there were unique elements, Argentina's demise seems 
certain to add to the doubts about the wisdom of bailouts, 
doubts that have grown in recent years. Nearly every major 
financial rescue effort, including those in Mexico, Thailand, 
Indonesia, South Korea, Russia and Brazil, has come under 
intense scrutiny from the left and the right, albeit for widely 
varying reasons.

  Fund officials say privately that they cannot avoid financial 
bailouts altogether. The lesson of Argentina, they say, is that 
they need to find a way to say no before the people they are 
supposed to be helping take to the streets.

Bush Plan Expected to Slow, Not Halt, Gas Emission Rise

 



  President Bush is set to announce a plan today calling for 
voluntary measures to slow but not halt the growth in emissions 
of heat-trapping gases linked to global warming, White House 
officials said last night.

  The climate proposal is Mr. Bush's response to the Kyoto 
Protocol, the 1997 treaty accepted but not yet ratified by all 
other large industrialized countries, which would require cuts 
in such emissions by 2010 to well below their 1990 levels. Mr. 
Bush rejected the treaty last March, calling its targets 
arbitrary, its schedule too costly to meet and its terms, which 
are not easily applied in large developing countries, unfair.

  The program he is to announce this afternoon would slow the rate 
of growth in emissions in relation to the growth of the overall 
economy. It would use $4.6 billion in tax credits over the next 
five years to encourage companies and individuals to limit those 
emissions.

  Utilities, for example, would get incentives to build 
power-generating windmills; homeowners would get new tax credits 
for buying solar panels or more efficient cars.

  The one thing the climate policy would not do is require 
anything of anybody, sticking with the position Mr. Bush has 
held for more than a year on the climate issue: that firm limits 
on the so-called greenhouse gases would drag down the economy.

  The administration's approach, he plans to say, is based "on the 
common-sense idea that sustainable economic growth is the key to 
environmental progress - because it is growth that provides the 
resources for investment in clean technologies," according to an 
advance text.

  On another emissions issue unrelated to climate, aides said Mr. 
Bush would call today for mandatory restrictions on three other 
kinds of pollutants from power plants: mercury, sulfur dioxide 
and nitrogen oxides. In contrast to proposals by 
environmentalists and many Democrats, however, the plan would 
delay such cuts until 2010 or later.

  Last night, administration officials called the voluntary 
approach on climate the most reasonable path for the time being. 
A senior administration official did say, however, that if 
insufficient progress was being made by 2012, there could be a 
move toward some kind of limits. "If we're not making progress 
toward our goal," he said, "we will be considering a full range 
of programs."

  Some environmental groups criticized this kind of checkup, 
saying it puts off any measuring of progress until well after 
Mr. Bush is out of office.

  Under the administration's proposed target, the growth rate of 
emissions of carbon dioxide would drop nearly 18 percent by 2012 
- to 151 metric tons for each $1 million in gross domestic 
product, from the current level of 183 metric tons.

  But environmental groups sharply criticized this kind of 
yardstick, saying that it merely reflects an existing trend 
toward using energy more efficiently and adding that as long as 
the economy grows, this would not result in emissions 
reductions.

  Alluding to the date of the speech, Jennifer Morgan, the climate 
policy director for the World Wildlife Fund, called it "a 
valentine to the coal and oil industry that will allow emissions 
to increase without any time frame, eternally."

  One provision of the new climate plan would be to greatly expand 
a program encouraging businesses to monitor and report their 
emissions of greenhouse gases. Those that participate, 
voluntarily, would gain credits that might eventually be used in 
a trading scheme similar to that used for other pollution.

  White House officials said this could prompt industries to 
change behavior, the same way similar reporting requirements 
instituted in the late 1980's resulted in big cuts in releases 
of toxic chemicals.

  Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, 
a private lobbying group, criticized this approach, saying: "The 
president's global warming proposal appears to be another 
faith-based initiative: we should have faith that major 
corporations will line up to volunteer cuts in their carbon 
pollution. That approach has failed for a decade now, since the 
president's father set up the first voluntary program."

  And Myron Ebell, a climate policy expert at the Competitive 
Enterprise Institute, a private group whose free- market views 
are frequently embraced by industry, criticized the idea from 
the opposite ideological direction.

  "What looks like voluntary will actually be coercive," Mr. Ebell 
said.

  The president is leaving for Asia on Saturday and has been under 
pressure to present a climate plan before visiting Japan. Japan, 
which has avoided criticizing the administration over its 
rejection of the treaty, has been eager for a sign that Mr. Bush 
is concerned about the issue. Several experts on the treaty said 
that his decision to make the announcement now was very likely 
influenced by this situation.

  The proposed plan on nongreenhouse emissions from power plants - 
mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides - would impose 
mandatory limits but would allow companies to exceed them by 
buying credits from others that reduce pollution below required 
levels.

  There would be no similar limits on power plants' emissions of 
carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. In the face of lobbying 
from coal companies and utilities, Mr. Bush abandoned a campaign 
pledge last March to control the four plant emissions together 
and has shown no signs of reconsidering that idea.

  As hints of the emerging plan circulated in e-mail messages by 
environmental groups and conservative groups, it appeared that 
no one was particularly pleased.

  An official at an energy company that had been pressing the 
White House to revise power plant rules said the best news was 
that there was something finally on the table to discuss.

  "At least they're coming out with something," the official said. 
"It may not be what everyone wants, but it recognizes that the 
Senate is going to deal with climate on its power plant bill."

Rumsfeld Defends U.S. Treatment of Detainees in Cuba

 



  WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 - Frustrated by an international outcry over 
the American treatment of prisoners in Cuba, Secretary of 
Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld defended the United States' conduct 
at length today and dismissed the criticism as breathless 
armchair hyperbole.

  "I am telling you what I believe in every inch of my body to be 
the truth, and I have spent a lot of time on secure video with 
the people down there," he told reporters, referring to the 
United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where 158 
prisoners from the war in Afghanistan are being jailed. "I 
haven't found a single scrap of any kind of information that 
suggests that anyone has been treated anything other than 
humanely."

  Mr. Rumsfeld spoke in an unusual briefing that stretched over an 
hour in an attempt, he said, to "tap down some of this 
hyperbole." It was prompted by a rising tide of international 
criticism after the Defense Department released photographs over 
the weekend that showed some of the prisoners kneeling before 
their captors, their legs in shackles, their hands bound in 
manacles, their mouths covered by surgical masks and their eyes 
blinded by large goggles with black tape.

  His comments came as criticism swelled from abroad. Critics said 
the United States was using sensory deprivation and other 
psychological control techniques to weaken the prisoners so that 
interrogations would be more fruitful. The International 
Committee of the Red Cross, in a rare break with its code of not 
publicly criticizing detaining governments, said the United 
States might have violated Geneva Convention rules against 
making a spectacle of prisoners by distributing the pictures, 
which were published worldwide.

  Amnesty International sought access to the prisoners in 
Guantanamo and said they should be allowed to have lawyers.

  "Keeping prisoners incommunicado, sensory deprivation, the use 
of unnecessary restraint and the humiliation of people through 
tactics such as shaving them are all classic techniques employed 
to break the spirit of individuals ahead of interrogation," the 
organization said.

  Several governments joined the chorus, saying the prisoners 
should be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva 
Convention. Such status would accord them the highest level of 
protections.

  Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief, said 
that despite the Sept. 11 atrocities, "changing our values and 
our way of life would be terrorism's first victory." The 
Netherlands also urged Washington to recognize the detainees as 
prisoners of war, saying, "In the fight, we need to uphold our 
norms and values."

  While debate raged elsewhere, Britain and Spain supported the 
United States. Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said the three 
British prisoners at the detention center, called Camp X-Ray, 
"had no complaints about their treatment." Spanish Foreign 
Minister Josep Pique said the Spanish government "does not have 
the slightest doubt regarding the position of the U.S. 
government."

  The warden at Camp X-Ray, Col. Terry Carrico, said he was 
determined at all times to maintain what he called "positive 
control" over the prisoners. Bill Nash, a retired Army major 
general and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, 
said this amounted to "imposing on them a psychological sense of 
isolation, domination and futility, and trying to establish the 
conditions by which you can then reward them for information, as 
oppose to punish them."

  Mr. Rumsfeld said it was "probably unfortunate" that the 
photographs were released, at least without an explanation. He 
said the prisoners had been photographed in a holding area just 
before their restraints were removed and they were put in their 
cages.

  "If you want to think the worst about things, you can," he said. 
But he argued that whenever prisoners, especially those who are 
dangerous and suicidal, are transported, it only makes sense to 
lock them in restraints. "When they are being moved from place 
to place, will they be restrained in a way so that they are less 
likely to be able to kill an American soldier? You bet. Is it 
inhumane to do that? No. Would it be stupid to do anything else? 
Yes."

  It is not clear why the United States has not officially 
designated the detainees as prisoners of war, especially since 
Mr. Rumsfeld said they are essentially being treated as such.

  "They're in legal limbo," said Michael F. Noone, professor of 
military law at Catholic University. "The United States has to 
get moving on screening these people and determining whether or 
not they're P.O.W.'s. There is no explanation for the delay."

  Mr. Rumsfeld said the Pentagon's clear priority with the 
prisoners was to extract information from them to prevent future 
attacks. "These people are committed terrorists," he said. "We 
are keeping them off the street and out of the airlines and out 
of nuclear power plants and out of ports across this country and 
across other countries."

  And yet, officials at Guantanamo have said that no interrogation 
has taken place on the base and that the prisoners do not have 
lawyers.

  Asked what benefit the United States gets by not classifying the 
captives as prisoners of war, Mr. Rumsfeld said, "I don't know 
enough of the legal technicalities to answer your question. I 
know that the process of gathering the intelligence information 
has not been concluded."

  Mr. Rumsfeld said one of the complicating factors was that the 
Geneva Conventions give protection to prisoners from countries 
but not from terrorist organizations, like Al Qaeda, to which 
some of the prisoners apparently belong. "To give standing under 
a Geneva Convention to a terrorist organization that's not a 
country is something that I think some of the lawyers who did 
not drop out of law school as I did worry about as a precedent," 
he said.

  Officials have said the prisoners come from a range of 
countries, - Britain, Yemen, China, Saudi Arabia and Australia 
among them - and that has also complicated the legal picture.

  In Los Angeles, a federal district judge questioned today 
whether he had the authority to consider a challenge to the 
detention of the prisoners in Cuba.

  "I have grave doubts about whether I have jurisdiction," said 
the judge, A. Howard Matz. He spoke at a hearing on a petition 
filed on Sunday by a group of lawyers, clerics and professors 
who demand that the detainees be identified, taken before a 
court and told of the charges against them.

More Prisoners Detained in Guantanamo Bay Join Hunger Strike

 



  Strike Triggered by a TurbanAccording to military sources at the 
U.S. base, the hunger striker was first triggered on Wednesday 
when the guard took the turban off the detainee's head while he 
was still praying.

  The sources argued that it was against the rules of the prison 
because the turban could be used to conceal a weapon.

  Bush Criticized for Treating Detainees InhumanelyAs more inmates 
joined the hunger strike, some of them reportedly chanted 
rhythmically on Thursday. Prison officials have reportedly 
strengthened the already heavy security at the prison for 
precautions.

  The Bush administration has been under international criticism 
for not treating the detainees humanely. It recently bowed to 
international pressure to grant the Taliban prisoners the status 
of prisoner of war but still refused to cover al Qaeda prisoners 
with the same treatment.

U.S. Closely Monitoring Situation in Argentina

 



  The Bush administration was closely monitoring the situation in 
Argentina where escalating economic crisis led to a wave of 
bloody street violence and looting, the White House said on 
Thursday.

  "Argentina is a valued ally and friend, and the United States is 
monitoring developments in Argentina. We are concerned about the 
events," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters at a 
regular news briefing.

  Argentine President Fernando De la Rua declared a national state 
of siege Wednesday night and ordered additional security forces 
into the streets to control violence that left at least six 
people dead and hundreds wounded or arrested. It was Argentina's 
worst unrest in a decade.

Angry at Vote, Commonwealth Bars Zimbabwe

 



  LONDON, March 19 - Flanked by the presidents of South Africa and 
Nigeria, Prime Minister John Howard of Australia today announced 
a yearlong suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, a group 
of 54 nations, mostly former British colonies. The unusual step 
was meant to punish President Robert Mugabe for his stewardship 
of elections this month that were widely criticized outside 
Africa as rigged.

  The two African leaders, Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and 
Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, maintained a cryptic silence while 
Mr. Howard spoke, endorsing the decision by their presence at a 
news conference but avoiding embroilment in a debate over 
whether they now view Mr. Mugabe's presidency as illegitimate.

  While less than an expulsion, the move still deepened the 
diplomatic isolation of Zimbabwe, which has already been 
battered by political violence, hunger, economic decline and the 
threat of labor unrest. It means Zimbabwean officials will be 
barred from meetings held by the Commonwealth, an organization 
that carries some cachet as an important club bridging the 
north-south divide.

  The suspension was decided by the three men, who met as a 
committee charged with deciding the Commomwealth's response. The 
decision, made at the headquarters in Marlborough House, has 
left two of the men facing an acute dilemma.

  Mr. Mbeki and Mr. Obasanjo - both of whose countries have under 
past undemocratic regimes been excluded from the Commonwealth - 
are torn between solidarity with a fellow African leader who was 
a crusader against colonialism, and their commitment to 
democratic standards as part of African economic regeneration. 
Mr. Howard was chairman of the three-nation committee.

  The move avoids an open rift between its majority members in 
Africa and Asia, some of which have tended to side with Mr. 
Mugabe, and rich, white-ruled countries like Britain, Canada and 
Australia, which have criticized him. Yet it adds one more voice 
to those labeling Mr. Mugabe a pariah and increasing pressure on 
him to seek reconciliation, possibly through new elections.

  The opprobrium spread further today when Switzerland became the 
latest country to impose sanctions on Zimbabwe, "in view of the 
manipulation of the presidential elections and ongoing human 
rights violations," the Swiss government said.

  Under other restrictions, Mr. Mugabe and Zimbabwe's most senior 
leaders are already barred from travel to the United States and 
the European Union.

  "The committee has decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils 
of the Commonwealth for a period of one year with immediate 
effect," Mr. Howard said, reading the statement alone, 
apparently as a face-saving gesture to Mr. Mbeki, whose own 
election observers in Zimbabwe found the vote "legitimate."

  The response to Mr. Mugabe's behavior was seen by many outsiders 
as a token of South Africa's and Nigeria's own commitment to 
democracy as a way of fostering economic renewal. At a meeting 
in Monterrey, Mexico, for instance, the financier George Soros 
said today that the Zimbabwe elections "have cast doubt on the 
ability of the African states to create suitable conditions for 
private investment."

  If the Commonwealth had not suspended Zimbabwe - an act Mr. 
Howard saw as "at the severe end" of available punishments - 
such criticism would only have sharpened. Yet many African 
politicians, including Morgan Tsvangirai, the Zimbabwe 
opposition leader defeated in the election, had expressed doubt 
that the Commonwealth would take any action at all.

  The suspension was accompanied by suggestions for easing 
Zimbabwe's drastic food shortages and economic decline. The 
Commonwealth also supported moves to resolve the country's 
violent crisis over the seizure of white farmers' land, backing 
Mr. Mugabe in his commitment to redistribute territory among 
landless black Zimbabweans. This was apparently intended to keep 
the door open to dialogue.

  "Land is at the core of the crisis in Zimbabwe," Mr. Howard said 
in his statement.

  According to the statement, the leaders of South Africa and 
Nigeria will continue to talk to Mr. Mugabe about ways to lift 
the suspension.

  For all its critics say it is ineffective, the Commonwealth has 
nonetheless sought to project itself as an arbiter of democratic 
legitimacy among often delinquent members.

  In the 60's, white-ruled South Africa quit the Commonwealth 
rather than be suspended over apartheid; Nigeria was suspended 
in the 1990's during military rule because of the execution of 
the human rights activist Ken Saro Wiwa. Fiji has been suspended 
twice, once for 10 years. Pakistan has been suspended since the 
military coup two years ago that brought Gen. Pervez Musharraf 
to power.

Argentine Leader Quits as Economy Begins a Free Fall

 



  BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 20 - President Fernando de la R?signed 
today, halfway through his four-year term, swamped by violent 
protests and looting that erupted when his government failed to 
reverse a deepening economic crisis.

  The resignation letter, which was delivered to Congress late in 
the day, followed violent food riots and protests here and in 
several cities. At least five demonstrators were killed today, 
bringing the death toll to 21 since the protests began early 
Wednesday.

  The president had made a last- ditch effort to form a unity 
government today with the leading opposition party, but when 
that was rejected, he announced he would leave.

  Argentina, with widening budget deficits, is heavily indebted to 
foreign lenders and is battling to prevent more defaults. After 
a series of budget cuts and a patchwork of economic programs, 
the country lacks a coherent economic and monetary strategy, and 
has no consensus as to what should be done.

  Mr. de la R?resignation will put the country's immediate 
future in the hands of the moderate opposition party that 
controls Congress and had recently begun blocking many of the 
former president's policies.

  Ram?uerta, the president of the Senate, is to become 
Argentina's provisional president for at least 48 hours while 
the Congress decides how to prepare for new elections, which are 
likely sometime next year. Under the law, a new president should 
be installed within three months.

  But Congress can change that, and how it will play its hand will 
be largely left to opposition leaders, including a former 
president, Carlos Sa?nem, and Senator Eduardo Duhalde, who 
lost to Mr. de la R? the 1999 elections.

  Whoever takes power is expected to face the same tough choices 
that defeated the indecisive Mr. de la R?aced with recession 
and declining exports, some Wall Street analysts have predicted 
that Argentina will devalue its currency by unhinging the peso 
from its unusual one-for- one link to the dollar.

  While such a move would lower prices and spur growth by making 
the country's goods more attractive, it could also prove ruinous 
to millions of borrowers and to the nation's banking system 
because most loans in the country are repayable in dollars, not 
pesos.

  Mr. de la R?government collapsed with surprising rapidity, 
as the police fired shotguns at demonstrators in front of his 
palace, tear gas seeped into presidential offices and fires 
filled the grand boulevards and avenues of Buenos Aires with 
towers of black smoke.

  Thousands of demonstrators massed and set bonfires in front of 
the Congress and presidential palace throughout the day, until 
riot police, including some on horseback, stormed through the 
crowds this afternoon clubbing people while reinforcements fired 
water cannon and rubber bullets.

  Defiant crowds chanted "assassins, assassins, assassins," making 
the scenes of anarchy reminiscent of the turbulent days of 
military rule from 1976 to 1983. With the 5 deaths today, more 
than 1,000 demonstrators and looters were arrested. More than 50 
police officers were reported hurt in the disturbances in the 
capital alone.

  The violence today followed looting and rioting in 11 of 
Argentina's 24 provinces on Wednesday, and much damage to 
private businesses, especially food stores. Mr. de la R?eclared a state of siege for 30 days on Wednesday, giving him 
the right to suspend such Constitutional rights as freedom of 
assembly and speech, and giving him free rein to arrest at will.

  But his assumption of emergency powers appeared only to incite 
greater protests, beginning with an outpouring of thousands of 
people Wednesday night onto the streets of Buenos Aires, banging 
pots and pans and demanding Mr. de la R?resignation.

  In an attempt to save his government, Mr. de la R?4, went on 
national television on Wednesday night and apologized to the 
people for their disappointment in his administration's 
performance. He called on the opposition party, known as the 
Justicialist party, "to participate in a national unity 
government in which they can bring in their ideas and programs."

  When that call was rebuffed, Mr. de la R?ld his closest 
aides that he had no choice but to tape a televised resignation 
address.

  As soon as Nicolas Gallo, a senior personal aide to Mr. de la 
R?old reporters late this afternoon that the president had 
decided to resign, the streets began to calm. The text of the 
speech said the resignation was to "assure the peace."

  Mr. Gallo told reporters, "the president wanted to avoid more 
suffering." He said "history will judge" how Mr. de la R?
administration would be seen. "It's been a very sad day," he 
added.

  Most opposition party leaders have called for the devaluation of 
the peso and suspension of payment on the country's debts.

  They are also suggesting that business and consumer loans that 
are now valued in dollars be revalued into new peso amounts that 
would reduce the overall debt. The lower loan amounts would 
benefit individuals whose income is expected to decline by 30 
percent to 50 percent in a peso devaluation.

  This scheme is designed to help middle-class people with home 
mortgages and car loans that are currently valued in dollars.

  The losers would be bank lenders because the loans would not be 
fully repaid. Other losers could well be Argentine businesses 
that owe dollar debts abroad but collect revenue in pesos at 
home. It would take a greater number of devalued pesos to repay 
their dollar loans.

  "I believe the economy can be stabilized and grow during a 
transition government," said Governor Adolfo Rodr?ez Saa of 
San Luis Province, an influential member of the opposition.

  Mr. de la R?decline began in October 2000 with the 
resignation of his vice president, Carlos Alvarez, over the 
government's handling of charges that bribes were paid to 
opposition senators to pass a new labor law.

  Mr. de la R?ruling Alianza coalition of centrists and Social 
Democrats fractured, and his cabinet became a revolving door of 
officials and constantly changing economic policies.

  Then, in October, his coalition suffered a devastating defeat in 
legislative elections that gave the opposition control of both 
houses of Congress.

  Cabinet officials on Wednesday publicly accused the Buenos Aires 
governor, Carlos Ruckauf, a former vice president and one of the 
most powerful leaders of the opposition, of instigating the 
looting to overthrow the government.

  During an emergency meeting of the cabinet on Wednesday, 
ministers debated whether to openly confront Governor Ruckauf 
with charges of treason. Some aides to Mr. de la R?gued that 
the federal government should seize Governor Ruckauf's Buenos 
Aires provincial police force in order to control the rioting 
that surged in the working-class neighborhoods that surround the 
capital city.

  But Mr. de la R?sitated, and instead declared a state of 
siege, which failed to bring peace. Now Mr. Ruckauf is 
considered a major presidential contender.

Finance Minister of Argentina Resigns Post

 



  The uncertainty of Argentina's precarious financial situation 
deepened yesterday when Daniel Marx, the finance secretary, 
resigned.

  Mr. Marx stepped down as Argentina paid $700 million in 
short-term debt owed to local banks by forcing pension funds to 
buy government bonds. The payment was the first of two in 
December that would hold off a default on its public debt.. 
Argentina has been struggling to contain its public debt, now 
totaling about $132 billion, after four years of recession.

  In discussing his decision, Mr. Marx suggested that it was time 
for someone else to oversee the government's negotiations with 
its creditors. "It's a cycle," he said. "I had also some 
personal things to deal with."

  Mr. Marx added that he would still work with the government, in 
a capacity that had not yet been formalized. "I agreed to 
continue to work on the national debt issues for Argentina," he 
said.

  In the last few weeks, working with the economy minister, 
Domingo Cavallo, Mr. Marx had been trying to persuade 
Argentina's foreign creditors to accept lower interest rates on 
existing debts. Domestic creditors already agreed, under some 
duress, to swap roughly $40 billion in obligations for new 
loans. Mr. Marx said that his foreign consultations had been 
proceeding "according to schedule."

  There was no doubt, however, that Mr. Marx's job had recently 
become tougher. The International Monetary Fund decided last 
week to delay the release of $1.3 billion in aid, which is 
needed to cover a budget shortfall. During the last few months, 
political infighting has eroded the government's ability to 
adhere to the zero-deficit rule favored by the I.M.F. and 
promised by Mr. Cavallo.

  Mr. Marx's resignation also followed a national strike on 
Thursday by union members, shopkeepers and unemployed workers, 
which brought the country close to a standstill. The strikers 
were protesting federal budget cuts and restrictions on 
withdrawals from bank accounts.

  Mr. Cavallo instituted the banking controls on Dec. 1 to stave 
off a run on Argentina's banks. Depositors who worried that the 
peso's fixed one-to-one exchange rate with the dollar was about 
to be broken by a devaluation, despite Mr. Cavallo's insistence 
to the contrary, were withdrawing dollars from bank accounts. A 
sudden, widespread drop in deposits threatened to choke economic 
activity and worsen the country's financial troubles.

  The controls were a sign of the financial pressures on 
Argentina, according to Vincent Truglia, an analyst at Moody's 
(news/quote). "They were indicative of the very difficult 
situation that the country was in and continues to be in," he 
said.

  Mr. Marx declined to say in an interview whether he had favored 
imposing the restrictions.

  Mr. Marx became finance secretary in December 1999 after a 
career in private finance and a stint on the board of 
Argentina's central bank. The finance secretary is effectively 
the economy minister's deputy, with specific responsibility for 
the public debt.

  Mr. Marx kept his job through the resignation and replacement of 
two economy ministers, Jose Luis Machinea and Ricardo 
Lopez-Murphy, and the return of Mr. Cavallo to government. His 
technical knowledge and strong relations with Argentina's 
foreign creditors won him considerable respect at home and 
abroad.

  Mr. Marx is known for favoring market-based rather than 
regulatory solutions to economic problems, a reputation shared 
by Julio Dreizzen, who resigned as finance undersecretary on 
Oct. 29, citing personal reasons.

  Mr. Marx's departure may pave the way for Miguel Kiguel, an 
economist from the Justicialist opposition party, to join Mr. 
Cavallo's team. On Thursday, Argentina's president, Fernando de 
la Rua  met with Carlos Sa?nem, a former president and 
leader of the Justicialists, to discuss economic strategy. The 
appointment of Mr. Kiguel to succeed Mr. Marx may be seen as a 
way to bring the Justicialists into Mr. De La Rua's ruling 
coalition, forming a sort of national unity government to 
address the economy.

Six days that shook Venezuela

 



  CARACAS (AFP) - Here are the main events of the crisis that 
shook Venezuela over the past six days, in which at least 41 
people were killed and 323 were injured:

  Tuesday, April 9: Venezuela's largest trade union joins a strike 
by managers at the country's massive state-run oil company, 
demanding the resignation of a new board of directors appointed 
by President Hugo Chavez.

  Wednesday, April 10: Union leaders extend the strike for 24 
hours because of what they call Chavez's `aggressive' and 
`intolerant' response to their demands. The strike is later made 
indefinite.

  - Oil exports, which account for 80 per cent of Venezuela's 
foreign revenues, are threatened as the strike stops production 
at the country's major refineries.

  Thursday, April 11: Some 50,000 people, including business and 
union leaders, mass to demand Chavez's resignation. The 
government urges supporters to back Chavez.

  - Chavez orders a suspension of broadcasts by private television 
networks opposed to him.

  - Pro-government and opposition demonstrators face off in 
Caracas. At least 15 people are killed and almost 100 are 
wounded.

  - A group of 10 top military officials declare their opposition 
to Chavez.

  
- Leading military officials in the Chavez government resign.

  Friday, April 12: Army commander General Efrain Vazquez 
announces that Chavez wants to resign.

  - The commander of Venezuela's paratrooper brigade - Chavez's 
old unit - refuses to recognise orders of the interim 
government.

  - Chavez is transferred from an army base in Caracas to the 
island of Orchila, in the Caribbean Sea.

  - Thousands of Chavez supporters march towards the Presidential 
palace.

  
- Carmona takes refuge at Tiuna Fort, southwest of Caracas.

  - Top military leaders say their support of Carmona is 
conditional upon his respecting democratic institutions and 
allowing Chavez to leave Venezuela freely.

  - Carmona announces the restoration of the National Assembly, as 
Chavez cabinet members move into the Presidential palace and 
hold a meeting.

  - Carmona resigns the interim presidency, and Chavez's 
vice-President, Diosdado Cabello, takes over as acting 
President. Carmona is arrested along with his cabinet and 
general staff. Cabello promises to restore constitutional order.

  Sunday: Chavez leaves Orchila Island aboard a helicopter and 
heads to Caracas.

  - Chavez officially re-takes the presidency in an emotional 
Presidential palace ceremony at 4:30 am (0830 GMT). He then 
calls for peace, calm, and `the unity of the country.'

  - Emergency workers say that in total, at least 41 people have 
been killed and 323 injured in rioting around the country since 
Thursday.


U.S. Refuses to Recognize Mugabe Government

 



  U.S. President Bush said Wednesday that flaws in Zimbabwe's 
election will prevent the United States from recognizing the 
government's claim that incumbent Robert Mugabe was the winner.

  Bush told a news conference that the United States is consulting 
with other countries to decide how "to deal with this flawed 
election."

  Bush suspended U.S. entry privileges for Mugabe, his family or 
senior members of his government.

  He also denied entry to those who received "significant 
financial benefit" from dealings with Zimbabwean officials who 
carried out Mugabe's policies.

  U.S. officials said the administration may freeze assets of 
Zimbabwean officials involved in the alleged rigging of the 
democratic process.

  Another possibility is the banning of commercial export licenses 
of defense articles and services.

U.S. Begins First Airlift of Prisoners

 



  WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 - A C-17 Globemaster cargo plane carrying 20 
heavily guarded Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners left a Marine 
Corps base in southern Afghanistan today on its way to the 
United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the first wave 
of hundreds of detainees who will be held there.

  The Pentagon provided few details about the flight, but senior 
military officials said more than 40 specially trained military 
police officers guarded the prisoners on the flight, which was 
expected to make one stop before reaching Cuba, possibly as 
early as Friday morning.

  The prisoners, their hands and feet shackled and their heads 
covered by hoods, were loaded single file onto the plane at 
Kandahar Airport. Pentagon officials said some prisoners might 
also be sedated during the more-than-20-hour flight, but it was 
not clear whether that had happened.

  A Pentagon official said earlier this week that the United 
States did not consider the detainees prisoners of war, but that 
they were still being afforded the protections under the Geneva 
Convention guidelines.

  At Guantanamo Bay, the prisoners will be taken to a makeshift 
detention center known as Camp X- Ray, where they will be locked 
in 6- by-8-foot cages made of concrete and chain-link fence to 
await intensive interrogation and, possibly, trial before 
military tribunals.

  As workers prepared the camp in Cuba for as many as 2,000 
prisoners, search crews in Pakistan continued to comb the 
wreckage of a Marine Corps tanker plane that crashed on 
Wednesday in southwestern Pakistan. Seven marines died in the 
fiery accident.

  Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that there 
was no evidence that the crash had been caused by hostile fire.

  Pentagon officials also said today that the United States was 
preparing to send a force of more than 100 soldiers, many of 
them Special Operations forces, to the Philippines to help train 
Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf 
group.

  Though the American forces are expected to be involved initially 
in advising and training Filipino counterterrorist units, senior 
American military officials have said they could become involved 
in direct military action if the Philippine government requested 
it.

  Amnesty International issued a statement today saying that 
sedating prisoners or shackling them for an entire flight would 
violate international standards prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or 
degrading" treatment.

  Mr. Rumsfeld said today that he did not know how the prisoners 
would be restrained during the flight. But he defended the use 
of strong measures, saying the Pentagon had closely studied 
violent uprisings by Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners held in the 
northern Afghan city of Mazar- i-Sharif and in Pakistan.

  About 20 minutes after the C-17 lifted off from the base at 
Kandahar Airport, marines came under small- arms fire near one 
of the runways. No one was injured and the identify of the 
snipers remained unknown tonight, military officials said.

  Military officials also said John Walker Lindh, the American who 
was captured with Taliban forces near Mazar-i-Sharif, was not 
among the prisoners transferred today. Mr. Walker is still being 
held aboard the assault ship Bataan in the Arabian Sea, the 
officials said.

  American forces in Afghanistan were holding a total of 371 
prisoners today, including 351 at Kandahar and 19 at Bagram air 
base north of Kabul. But the number keeps rising as American 
military and intelligence officials continue interviewing 
thousands of prisoners held by anti-Taliban militias.

  Camp X-Ray has cells for about 100 detainees, and will soon be 
expanded to hold 220. During the next few months, military work 
crews will build permanent facilities for as many as 2,000 
prisoners.

  Mr. Rumsfeld declined to discuss details about the growing 
American involvement in the Philippines, where Abu Sayyaf 
guerrillas have been battling government troops in the southern 
island of Basilan. The rebels, who have been linked to Al Qaeda 
in the past, are holding two American hostages for ransom.

  But earlier this week, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. 
Wolfowitz said that American Special Operations forces might 
become involved in "direct support of Philippine military 
operations," though he added that the government seemed 
"anxious" to do the job itself.

  "There's no question that we believe that if they could clear 
the Abu Sayyaf group out of Basilan Island, that would be a 
small blow against the extended Al Qaeda network," Mr. Wolfowitz 
said.

  In November, President Bush promised to give the Philippines a 
$100 million antiterrorism aid package that would include 
weapons, training and shared intelligence. Since then, the 
United States has sent an array of equipment to the Philippine 
military, including a C-130 cargo plane, 30,000 M-16 rifles and 
8 UH- 1 Huey helicopters.

  In eastern Afghanistan, American B-1 and B-52 bombers dropped 
precision-guided weapons on the sprawling Al Qaeda training camp 
at Zhawar Kili near the Pakistan border today for the sixth time 
in just over a week.

  Senior military officials have said they are increasingly 
concerned that there are other equally sophisticated and 
well-fortified underground complexes elsewhere in Afghanistan 
that could become guerrilla bases for remnants of the Taliban 
and Al Qaeda forces.

  At the Pentagon, Mr. Bush signed a $318 billion military 
spending bill today for the 2002 fiscal year. "Today more than 
ever we also owe those in uniform the resources they need to 
maintain a very high state of readiness," Mr. Bush said. "Our 
enemies rely upon surprise and deception. They used to rely upon 
the fact that they thought we were soft. I don't think they 
think that way anymore."

Mugabe Predicts Victory in Zimbabwe's Election

 



  Zimbabwe's incumbent President Robert Mugabe Saturday predicted 
victory in the country's two- horse presidential race, saying 
that he will accept the outcome of the election because he will 
have defeated Morgan Tsvangirai of the opposition Movement for 
Democratic Change (MDC).

  Looking tired but blithesome after more than a month of daily 
election campaigns throughout the southern African country, 
Mugabe cast his vote in a weekend presidential poll, in which he 
is facing a serious challenge from his main rival Tsvangirai.

  The Zimbabwean veteran leader, who has been in power since the 
country gained independence from Britain in 1980, was 
accompanied to the polling station at a school in the poor 
suburb of Highfield in the capital Harare by family members, 
including two children.

  He told journalists after casting his ballot that he was more 
than confident of winning the election.

  "I will accept the results more than anything because I will 
have won," said Mugabe.

  He said those who thought the election process would be rigged 
were supporters of the MDC party, adding that they were 
prejudging and wanted to direct the process.

  Tension has risen sharply in Zimbabwe in recent months, after 
long and sometimes violent election campaigns. The MDC party has 
accused Mugabe of using violence and other electoral 
manipulation to rig the poll.

  While defying international pressure to back down from his 
controversial land reforms, Mugabe has said he needs a new six- 
year mandate to complete the reforms.

  Under these reforms, the Zimbabwean government has taken over 
excess and idle farms from white farmers, who own the bulk of 
the country's arable land, to resettle landless peasants.

  Nearly 500,000 people have been resettled since the beginning of 
last year.

  However, the program has drawn sharp international rebuke, 
particularly from former colonial power Britain, but Mugabe has 
vowed to press ahead with the reforms.

  The European Union imposed sanctions on Mugabe and 19 of his 
close associates last month, while the United States took the 
same move, accusing Mugabe of violating human rights and 
cracking down on the opposition, the media and judiciary.

  The controversial land reform is the pillar of Mugabe's 
electoral strategy, which political analysts say could work 
either way.

  In Mugabe's view, the March election is a new chapter in his 
long struggle against colonial rule, which he led from the early 
1960s until the country's independence.

  "We have to deliver and safeguard the most important heritage to 
the young generation - land - which was taken from our 
forefathers by force," he told a recent rally.

  Mugabe even talked about his desire to keep safeguarding 
Zimbabwe's sovereignty and land in spirit when he dies, a dream 
which the veteran leader said forced him to sacrifice a bright 
teaching career in the 1950s to lead his compatriots out of 
colonial rule.

  But that ambition would be fully tested at the ballot box this 
weekend.

Japan, U.S. Differ Over Global Warming Issues

 



  Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and visiting U.S. 
President George W. Bush differed over the Kyoto Protocol and 
how to prevent global warming but agreed to cooperate on that 
issue.

  Bush repeated his rejection of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol aimed 
atcurbing global warming, and pushed for the alternative he 
announced last week.

  Koizumi, meanwhile, called the new U.S. plan "a very 
constructive proposal," but asked for more efforts from the 
UnitedStates.

  "It is for the U.S. to decide whether to take part in the 
protocol or not, but I hope we will continue with our efforts so 
we can move in the same direction," said Koizumi, who supports 
theKyoto Protocol.

  "Both the economy and the environment can be improved 
together.We'd like to see further efforts on the part of the 
U.S.," the Japanese leader added.

  Bush rejected the Kyoto pact last March, saying that it would 
hurt U.S. economic growth.

  The U.S. president announced an alternative proposal last 
week,calling for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by 
companies in accordance with economic growth instead of 
mandatory reduction targets presented in the Kyoto pact.

  The proposal is criticized by environmentalists as ineffective 
for solving global warming and warn that under the plan U.S. 
greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise.

  In Monday's summit talks, Bush and Koizumi agreed to cooperate 
together with other countries, including developing nations, on 
the issue of global warming.

  Japan and the U.S. can cooperate over the development of new 
technologies in the field and that such technologies will help 
notonly the environment but also economic development, they 
agreed.

Taiwan Caucus a US Provocation: Commentary

 



  On April 9, the 23rd anniversary of the United States ' 
troublemaking Taiwan Relations Act, the US Congress is due to 
unveil a 70-member Taiwan caucus.

  Most congressional caucuses are issue-based or for particular 
racial groups but this one will be devoted solely to Taiwan, an 
inalienable part of China.

  It is claimed that the caucus will serve as an official channel 
for legislators from both the United States and the island to 
exchange ideas.

  Such a provocative move will obviously overshadow the renewed 
Sino-US relations. On a more dangerous level, it may provide 
fodder to Taiwan's military forces and play into the hands of 
Taiwan separatist extremists.

  One of the group's goals is to promote US military ties with 
Taiwan.

  This comes at a time when there have been conspicuous signs of 
ever-increasing US-Taiwan military ties.

  In mid-March, the US side granted Taiwan "Defence Minister" Tang 
Yiau-ming a visa so he could attend a conference sponsored by US 
military contractors in Florida. On the sidelines of the 
conference, he met senior Bush administration officials 
including Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and Assistant 
Secretary of State James Kelly.

  On March 22, Admiral Dennis Blair, commander-in-chief of the US 
Pacific Command, told the House Armed Services Committee that 
the United States and Taiwan can maintain a military balance 
across the Taiwan Straits if both sides continue modernizing 
their armed forces.

  It seems that this so-called military balance is what Taiwan 
leader Chen Shui-bian wants.

  Last Wednesday when receiving a special delegation from the US 
House of Representatives, Chen said that the strong support of 
the US Congress - which led to US arms sales to Taiwan in April 
last year - ensured a balanced cross-Straits military situation 
and peace in the Taiwan Straits.

  "President Bush reaffirmed the US promises to all Taiwanese and 
repeatedly declared he would abide by the Taiwan Relations Act - 
to provide Taiwan with the necessary protection against 
Beijing," Chen was quoted by the Taipei Times as saying.

  
In most cases, those who sow the wind will reap a whirlwind.

  The robust military build-up may not bring the so-called balance 
but menace instead cross-Straits peace and stability.

  Helping Taiwan build its military muscle will only foment 
pro-independence forces. Since the latest remarks and events may 
give these forces the impression that the United States is on 
their side and ready to provide military protection, they may 
become provocative enough to push the island to the edge.

Venezuela's Chief Forced to Resign; Civilian Installed

 



  CARACAS, Venezuela, April 12 - A transitional government headed 
by a leading businessman replaced President Hugo Chavez today, 
hours after military officers forced him to resign. It was a 
sudden end to the turbulent three-year reign of a mercurial 
strongman elected on promises to distance his country from the 
United States while uprooting Venezuela's old social order.

  Mr. Chavez, 47, a firebrand populist who had said he would 
remake Venezuela to benefit the poor, was obligated to resign in 
a meeting with three military officers about 3 a.m. today after 
large street protests on Thursday in which at least 14 people 
were killed by gunmen identified as his supporters.

  Early this morning, Mr. Chavez, in military fatigues and the 
trademark red beret of his left-leaning movement, was driven off 
to the Fort Tiuna army base in Caracas, where he was reported to 
be in custody.

  Pedro Carmona Estanga, the head of Venezuela's most important 
business association, was installed as interim president at a 
ceremony at 6 p.m. He promised that the new government would 
adhere to "a pluralistic vision, democratic, civil and ensuring 
the implementation of the law, the state of law."

  
Elections will be held within a year, officials said.

  The Bush administration laid the blame for Mr. Chavez's 
overthrow firmly with the ousted leader. Officials portrayed the 
ouster as a victory for democracy, even though Mr. Chavez was a 
legitimately elected president.

  "We know that the action encouraged by the Chavez government 
provoked this crisis," said Ari Fleischer, the White House 
spokesman. The Chavez government, he added, suppressed a 
peaceful demonstration and fired on unarmed protesters.

  However, Latin American leaders at a summit meeting in Costa 
Rica criticized Mr. Chavez's ouster as an "interruption of the 
constitutional order."

  A former army paratrooper who won office in 1998, Mr. Chavez 
presided over a stormy era when he seized control of the 
legislature, confronted the old-line political elite and steered 
the country into an alliance with Cuba.

  Mr. Carmona, the president of Fedeca-iras, a business 
association, said early today that Mr. Chavez had "presented his 
resignation." He spoke flanked by military officers who had 
rebelled against Mr. Chavez on Thursday night, the third day of 
a general strike called by his opponents.

  On the streets of this sprawling capital, opponents of the 
government took to the streets in the early morning hours, 
honking horns and waving the gold, blue and red of the 
Venezuelan flag. El Universal, a leading newspaper here, hailed 
the end with these words, "It's over!"

  The interim government quickly moved to undo Mr. Chavez's 
policies, dissolving the National Assembly controlled by his 
supporters, firing members of the Supreme Court and changing the 
country's official name back to the Republic of Venezuela. Mr. 
Chavez had renamed the country the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela.

  In addition, the interim government repealed 49 economic laws 
passed by the Chavez-controlled National Assembly last year, 
legislation that business leaders feared would damage the 
economy.

  While pledging to hold presidential elections within 365 days, 
officials said that Mr. Carmona, who had been a leader in the 
protest movement against Mr. Chavez, will not be able to run.

  Mr. Carmona named new ministers, including two active-duty 
military officers who rebelled against Mr. Chavez on Thursday 
night. He also named retired Brig. Gen. Guaicaipuro Lameda to 
head Petr?s de Venezuela, the huge state-owned oil company, 
which exports most of its oil to the United States.

  Mr. Chavez had fired Mr. Lameda in February and appointed a 
left-leaning ally in his place along with five board members 
close to his government, enraging thousands of office workers at 
the company.

  Mr. Carmona said that operations would return to normal at the 
oil company. It had been crippled when office and production 
workers began staging work slowdowns last week in protest.

  "Venezuelan society has reached a consensus to find a way 
forward, a way that necessitated a transitional government that 
guarantees the reestablishment of democracy," Mr. Carmona told 
reporters

  Mr. Carmona said that the transitional government was being 
formed with "the consensus of civil society and also from the 
military."

  Cuba called the change-over a coup and urged other countries to 
distance themselves from the new government. President Fidel 
Castro and Mr. Chavez had formed a close friendship.

  The interim government today ended Mr. Chavez's policy of 
offering oil to Cuba under terms favorable to Havana.

  Mr. Chavez's daughter, Mar?Gabriela, speaking in an interview 
on state television in Cuba, said that her father had not 
resigned. In a phone conversation Friday morning, just before he 
fell from power, he told her, "I am a jailed president," she 
said.

  The attorney general, Isa? Rodr?ez, also said Mr. Chavez had 
not resigned, but was forced out by military officers.

  President Vicente Fox of Mexico took a strong stand, saying his 
country would not recognize Venezuela's new government until 
elections were held. Diplomatic relations between the two 
countries, however, would continue.

  American officials praised the Venezuelan military and the 
police for defying Mr. Chavez, as well as television stations 
and other media outlets that continued to function despite 
government orders to shut down.

  "We wish to express our solidarity with the Venezuelan people 
and look forward to working with all democratic forces in 
Venezuela to ensure the full exercise of democratic rights," 
said Philip T. Reeker, a State Department spokesman.

  For now, the government focused on clearing up the events 
leading to the violence of Thursday afternoon, remembering the 
fallen and searching for those who were responsible. Mr. 
Chavez's interior minister, Ram?odr?ez Chac? was taken 
into custody, and the police were looking for a strong Chavez 
supporter, Freddy Bernal, the mayor of a district of Caracas.

  Security forces, meanwhile, searched the homes of members of the 
Bolivarian Circles, neighborhood groups that were formed by Mr. 
Chavez's government and that were accused by the interim 
government of responsibility in the shootings.

  Television broadcasts on Thursday showed several men in 
plainclothes firing semiautomatic handguns from a bridge over a 
busy street in downtown Caracas. Among the crowd of assailants 
were people in red berets and T-shirts bearing the name of Mr. 
Chavez's movement.

  Mr. Carmona said that "justice must be done" for the families of 
those killed. He promised that they would receive government 
benefits.

  Among Mr. Carmona's most pressing tasks now will be to assuage 
concerns in other countries about how Mr. Chavez's reign ended 
and deal with the polarization between rich and poor that 
divides this country, analysts familiar with Venezuela said.

  "The goal for his successors is to effectively tackle the 
pressing socio-economic issues that brought Chavez to power with 
so much popular support," said Russell Crandall, a Latin America 
specialist at Davidson College in North Carolina. "Chavez was 
right about the problems he saw in Venezuela. He was wrong about 
the solutions and the Venezuelan people made that very clear."

   Argentina braces for currency fall

 



  BUENOS AIRES - Nostalgia runs deep in Argentina. Even before its 
faltering economy produced an epic-sized default, and the 
country was thrust into its worst crisis since democracy was 
restored in 1983, Argentines were obsessed with their past 
triumphs.

  But now a different variety of nostalgia appears to be emerging. 
Some call it the Ford Falcon syndrome, a reference to the 
classic gas-guzzler that inefficient Argentine automakers 
continued to turn out in droves 20 years after it disappeared 
from US showrooms.

  The man whom some economists say is leading the step backward in 
time is the country's new president, Eduardo Duhalde, 
Argentina's fifth in two weeks. After four years of crippling 
recession, Duhalde and others are questioning whether 
Argentina's decade-long pursuit of free market reforms is the 
right solution.

  With his appointment by Congress last Wednesday to finish the 
two years left in the term vacated by ex-President Fernando de 
la R?he Peronist Duhalde is now promoting a number of 
emergency measures that would turn back the clock on liberal 
economic reforms.

  On Friday, President Duhalde asked Congress for broad new powers 
to end the country's decade-old currency regime that pegs the 
peso to the US dollar, to intervene in the banking system, to 
institute price controls, and to protect local industry and 
jobs. It was approved overwhelmingly by the lower house of 
Congress late Saturday and was expected to be passed by the 
Senate yesterday.

  Everyone from the International Monetary Fund in Washington to 
the traditional protectionists in Buenos Aires thought 
devaluation was necessary, if painful. But some analysts are 
concerned that Duhalde will follow it up with a return to the 
protectionism and failed policies that dominated the country's 
economy for half of this past century, until ex-President Carlos 
Menem changed course last decade and ushered in an era of 
stability.

  "He must think he can defy gravity, because he's pursuing the 
same crash course that Argentines and the rest of Latin America 
rejected a decade ago," says Christopher Ecclestone, head of 
investment boutique Buenos Aires Trust.

  Duhalde's embrace of the past can be partly explained by the 
nature of the Peronists themselves, whom Argentine literary 
giant Jorge Luis Borges once referred to as neither good nor 
bad, just incorrigible.

  The party, founded by Gen. Juan Domingo Peron in the 1940s, has 
long dominated Argentine politics, thanks to a deft mix of 
populist policies, nationalist rhetoric, and political 
patronage. A weekend poll by Aresco consultancy showed 52 
percent of Argentines "highly" in favor of Duhalde's stated 
economic plans and another 34 percent giving him "medium" 
approval - an indication of public confidence.

  But at a time when the country is desperate for investment and 
international aid to prevent an economic crisis from exploding 
further, it is unclear how far Duhalde could actually turn back 
the clock even if he wanted to.

  For starters, there's a wariness among economists that an 
expected 30 to 40 percent devaluation could spark a return to 
the chaotic days of the late 1980s, when 5,000-percent inflation 
was rampant. Already, everything from bread to computer parts 
has been marked up by as much as 20 percent in anticipation of 
the devaluation.

  To contain inflation and fill an expected $11 billion budget 
deficit this year, government officials say a rescue package of 
at least $15 billion is needed from the IMF and other lenders. 
Otherwise, the country's cash-strapped banks, which are being 
forced to accept lesser-valued pesos for loans made almost 
entirely in dollars, will collapse.

  But few expect the government's plan for reviving the country's 
moribund economy to elicit much support abroad. In fact, quite 
the contrary.

  Already a swarm of powerful lobbies representing foreign 
companies have descended on Buenos Aires to fight government 
plans to introduce price and capital controls. The government is 
also taking heat for its plans to violate privatization 
contracts signed a decade ago and unilaterally lower the rates 
mostly foreign-owned utilities can charge for public services 
like water and gas.

  "He's not just steering the economy into disaster, but he's 
breaking fundamental concepts like right to savings and the rule 
of law," says Abel Viglione, senior economist at local think 
tank Fiel. "No matter what economic policy is in place, that 
sort of trust takes several years, if not an entire generation, 
to rebuild."

  But the stiffest opposition may yet come from the Argentines 
themselves. Despite widespread fatigue caused by successive 
austerity drives, such as limiting bank withdrawals to $1,000 
per month, the overwhelming majority of Argentines still prefer 
the stability of the current economic model - despite its many 
shortcomings - to the disorder of a closed economy.

  Surveys show that more than 70 percent of the public opposes any 
changes to convertibility, as the currency regime is known.

  "Those who want to devalue are shameless," says Maria Estevez, a 
schoolteacher who earns $600 a month. "They want to hold us 
hostage and force us to buy goods that can be bought cheaper and 
better quality imported."

  Instead of blaming globalization, most Argentines point to 
corrupt politicians and indifferent institutions for 
precipitating the current crisis.

  For such an ambitious economic program to work requires a strong 
leader with popular support to implement it. But that's exactly 
what Duhalde most lacks. Although he's so far successfully 
rallied the country's political class behind him, Duhalde, a 
former vice president to Menem and two-time governor of Buenos 
Aires province, has been dogged by allegations of corruption 
throughout his career. His reputation as an old-style party boss 
was behind his defeat at the polls in 1999, when he posted the 
worst showing ever by a Peronist presidential candidate.

Blair not happy with new green deal

 



  The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, disagreed yesterday with 
Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the 
United States.

  The Federal Government denied that the agreement, signed this 
week, was a signal it was dumping the Kyoto Protocol on 
greenhouse gases.

  The Australian-US "climate action partnership" involves liaison 
between governments, businesses and research bodies on climate 
change.

  Critics say that on the one hand Australia is saying it does not 
want to dump Kyoto, yet on the other it is cosying up to the US 
- which does want to dump Kyoto.

  Australia's involvement in Kyoto has been in doubt ever since 
the US President, George Bush, announced last year that 
ratifying the protocol would hurt the US economy.

  The future of the protocol, which sets targets for all countries 
in an attempt to cut pollution, will be decided this year at a 
meeting in Johannesburg.

  A spokeswoman for the Environment Minister, David Kemp, said 
yesterday that the minister was on his way to talks with the 
European Union in Brussels after a formal visit to Washington, 
and that the Government was still committed to Kyoto.

  The Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, said 
yesterday that Australia "should not follow the US position on 
climate change".

  Mr Blair told the ABC that greenhouse gases were an area where 
there was an obvious disagreement with the US.

  Asked if the disagreement was also with Australia, Mr Blair 
said: "Yes. But I simply say to people, it is for individual 
countries to state their own position."

  
He was not sure the Kyoto Protocol actually went far enough.

  "The more I read about climate change, the more concerned I 
become about this issue."

   Zimbabwe vote a test of patience

 



  HARARE AND RUSHINGA, ZIMBABWE - Martha's neighbors know her as a 
high-ranking district official of Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF 
Party, the woman who drills local children each Friday in the 
party doctrine. But in her heart, the 38-year-old widow supports 
the opposition and keeps a Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) 
membership card hidden in a cooking pot.

  "We just want someone who can give us food, hospitals, school 
fees. A better life," says Martha, explaining why she voted for 
MDC candidate Morgan Tsvangirai.

  There are many Marthas here, people who marched to ZANU-PF 
anthems and cheered President Robert Mugabe at rallies, while 
secretly planning to vote for Mr. Tsvangirai. "People pretend to 
be ZANU-PF because they are afraid. They wear the T-shirts and 
go to the rallies, but inside, they don't believe," she says.

  After months of fear and intimidation, Zimbabweans streamed to 
the polls this weekend in record numbers to cast their votes in 
the country's first contested election since independence 22 
years ago. Many arrived at overburdened polling stations in the 
early hours of the morning and waited in the hot sun for the 
entire day without food.

  "You see this tarred road and this grass? That was my bed," says 
Janet, a Harare secretary, who waited for more than 27 hours at 
a polling station in the impoverished Harare suburb of 
Kuwadzana. "I wanted to go home, but I have to vote," she says. 
"This is a crucial presidential election. This is our future."

  Even as voters went to the polls over the weekend, the 
intimidation and attempts at rigging continued. The government 
slashed the number of polling stations in urban areas where the 
MDC is favored, while boosting the number in rural ruling-party 
strongholds. In Kuwadzana, there were seven polling stations for 
about 55,000 people. Rural Bindura had 41 polling stations for a 
smaller number of people.

  Now the country's 5.6 million voters are waiting anxiously for 
the results of the poll to be announced, although the voting, 
which was supposed to end Sunday, may stretch on for days. The 
question foremost in the minds of most Zimbabweans is whether 
attempts to rig the election through voter intimidation, last- 
minute election-law changes, and outright fraud have succeeded.

  An increasing number of local election monitors and 
international observers say the vote rigging has been so 
thorough that hopes for a free election are dead.

  "The main cheating took place long before election days," says 
Brian Murphy of the Zimbabwe Citizens support group, an 
organization whose members spread around the country this 
weekend privately monitoring the elections. Mr. Murphy points to 
the lack of independent voter education, the lack of any 
independent radio stations, and the ban on holding opposition 
rallies in many districts as just a few examples. "This is not a 
fair election," he says.

  
There is a deep faith here, however, in the power of democracy.

  Edward Murchabaiw arrived at a Rushinga polling station at 6 
a.m. in a wheelbarrow, his emaciated frame drowing in a faded 
blue suit-jacket. Murchabaiw, diagnosed in the last stages of 
AIDS, does not believe he will live to see the results of this 
election. But he wanted to sound his voice. "I am happy now," he 
says with a bright smile after voting. "I have made a 
difference."

  In urban areas, lines snaked for more than a mile and angry 
voters sometimes tried to push their way into polling booths. 
Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at one restless crowd, 
injuring at least 12 people. Some polls stayed open all night, 
with people voting by flickering candlelight or under harsh 
fluorescent bulbs.

  "The intention, of course, is that you frustrate as many voters 
as you can. Mugabe is trying to move the goal posts to 
disenfranchise people, these people he thinks will vote against 
him," said Tsvangirai, visiting one polling station where 
thousands waited angrily to cast their votes, waving their hands 
in the open-handed signal of the MDC.

  In rural areas, many polling stations stood empty by midday. 
Lines were not a problem, but transparency was.

  The MDC says that 52 percent of its rural polling agents were 
chased away, abducted, or refused accreditation by government 
officials, leaving the voting process open to widespread abuse. 
Old and illiterate voters were assisted by ZANU-PF officials who 
often directed them to vote for the incumbent president.

  At the Chaparandza Primary School in the rural Rushinga, Mary 
Mugumira, wearing a wool "USA 1997" hat, a long traditional 
dress, no shoes, and a confused look, asked the presiding 
officer to vote for her. He refused, but sent her to talk to the 
election officers - both of whom represented the ruling ZANU-PF 
party. A moment later she had decided, and the polling agent, 
smiling, put an "X" mark on the ballot in the space marked 
"Robert Mugabe, ZANU-PF."

  Despite everything, there is still hope in Zimbabwe that this 
election may bring change.

  "I am happy because I finally got to vote," says a jubilant 
Colin Chipepera, after waiting for more than 12 hours in one 
Harare voting line. "I think this is the final nail on the 
government's coffin. Even with all their tricks, there are too 
many of us."

Ministry Criticizes 'Odious' U.S. Report

 



  The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it was "surprised, to 
put it mildly" by the U.S. State Department's criticism of 
Russia's human rights record and objected in particular to the 
"odious" section on Chechnya.

  "One gets the impression that its writers simply used old 
drafts, as if nothing had happened in either Russia or the 
United States in recent years, as if the events of Sept. 11, 
2001 had not occurred and the international community had not 
closed ranks in the battle against terrorism," the ministry said 
in a statement.

  The State Department's annual human rights report, which was 
published Monday, said Russia had a poor record regarding the 
independence and freedom of the media and in Chechnya. Russian 
security forces in Chechnya have "demonstrated little respect 
for basic human rights and there were credible reports of 
serious violations, including numerous reports of extrajudicial 
killings by both the government and Chechen fighters," the 
report said.

  Russian officials from President Vladimir Putin on down have 
portrayed the conflict in Chechnya as a war against 
international terrorists. U.S. officials have partially endorsed 
that view, pointing to rebel leaders such as Shamil Basayev and 
the Jordanian-born Omar Ibn al Khattab, who are believed to have 
financial and other ties to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorist 
network.

  However, U.S. officials also note that some of the rebels do not 
have international ties, and they have criticized Russian 
military and police abuse of civilians -- although the criticism 
was toned down greatly after Russia became an enthusiastic 
member of the anti-terrorist coalition, sharing intelligence 
information, opening its airspace to humanitarian flights and 
giving a green light to U.S. military deployment in Central 
Asia.

  The Foreign Ministry said that the State Department 
pronouncement on Chechnya reflected the efforts of "certain 
circles" in the United States that object to the new 
U.S.-Russian partnership against international terrorism.

  "These circles have persistently tried to reanimate the 'Chechen 
problem,' and turn it again into an irritant in the 
Russian-American dialogue," the ministry said.

  The ministry also suggested that before judging others' rights 
records, the United States should investigate the situation at 
home, including the government's failure to ratify some 
international human rights agreements and the use of the death 
penalty. Russia introduced a moratorium on capital punishment, a 
prerequisite for joining the Council of Europe, in 1996.




Guantanamo's Unhappy Campers

Guantanamo's Unhappy Campers

  
The only abuse the detainees are experiencing is self-inflicted.

  
By Matt Labash

  GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA -- It's 5 A.M. at the Roosevelt Roads Naval 
station in Puerto Rico, and 20 journalists straggle to the gate 
in sleep-deprived silence to catch a plane to Guantanamo Bay. 
Many of us haven't been up this early in years. But after flying 
thousands of miles, then pub-crawling through the streets of Old 
San Juan last night, we are here because our military escorts 
insist we show up at this time, though the flight actually 
leaves four hours later. "The military operates on one 
principle," explains a savvy veteran: "Hurry up and wait."

  If we're not happy, that goes double for our public affairs 
babysitters. "I'm up to my ears in Vieques," says Navy Lt. Corey 
Barker, of the nearby bombing range/public relations fiasco that 
has been protested by everyone from Al Sharpton to obscure 
Kennedys. Now, Barker is stuck minding us as we light out for 
Guantanamo, the American naval station on the southeastern tip 
of Cuba. It is there that 158 al Qaeda/Taliban prisoners are 
being detained because, depending on who you ask, it is an 
ideal, sunny clime, it's not subject to the get-out-of-jail 
escape hatches of U.S. federal law, or because, as one senior 
Pentagon official says, "The lawyers didn't want to go on 
14-hour flights to some guano rock in the Pacific."

  Inside the air terminal, our baggage handlers check us in with 
the efficiency of Bulgarian DMV workers. A sign on the wall says 
"Air Terminal of the Year 2000." "I'd hate to see who got second 
place," whispers one reporter. As we wait for our flight on a 
creaky Pan Am jet, we are shunted off to the "VIP" room, so 
named because it has a coffee pot and seascape paintings that 
look pilfered from a south Florida retirement village. Here, we 
are given our media "indoctrination" packages, never an 
encouraging word if you aspire to reportorial autonomy. As we 
sit watching CNN, an unfounded rumor gains currency. Though it's 
Saturday, and we're supposed to be in Cuba until Monday, the 
military has changed plans and is going to make us leave 
Guantanamo Sunday morning. "One thing's for sure," says a wire 
reporter, "you won't have to sort through all your notes to 
decide what to lead with."

  Fearing an abbreviated schedule, I commence valuable 
newsgathering. Knowing that in some Taliban-held provinces, 
pederasty rivaled headless-goat polo (buzkashi) as the favorite 
pastime, I ask a Naval officer if there are any reports of 
Guantanamo prisoners turning to man-love. "Oh God no," he says. 
"Though there are some Air Force personnel over there, so who 
knows what's going on?"

  Another officer relays something we'll hear repeated often: that 
because of international political pressure, the prisoners are 
getting coddled. The latest report has Army guards directing 
detainees on which way to pray to Mecca. "They're actually going 
to paint arrows on the floors of the cells so they'll know to 
face north," he says. "You mean east," I say. "North, east, 
whatever," he replies, "I'm Lutheran--I don't know where the 
hell it is."

  A FEW hours later, we touch down at the Guantanamo landing strip 
on the isolated leeward side of the base (Gitmo, as it is 
nicknamed, is actually bisected by Guantanamo Bay). After 
getting sniffed by a German shepherd who's more interested in 
bombs than my colleague's Percocet, we're escorted to the media 
center, an ugly wood-paneled affair that sits next to a pink 
hangar. After another hour or two of waiting, a mouthy reporter 
loudly calls his editor so we can all hear him report the 
latest: "Same shit, different day. Though they're really 
cleaning up the media center. Curtains, an air conditioner, even 
a freakin' bulletin board!"

  The hospitality ends there. A stern sign on the bulletin board 
admonishes us to clean up after ourselves. The goodies set out 
on a table (grape beverage powder and apple jelly from 
meals-ready-to-eat packs) practically scream, "Can't wait till 
you leave." Many of us had secretly harbored the fantasy that we 
could talk our overseers into letting us go right up to the 
prisoners' cells, the terrorist equivalent of a field trip to 
the ASPCA.

  But as a gaggle of public affairs officers enter, they lay down 
two immutable laws: There will be no access to detainees (the 
Geneva Convention forbids making them a "public curiosity"). And 
we can go only where the officers take us. Running the public 
affairs show is Army Lt. Col. William Costello, a bearish 
soldier who looks like the kind of guy who enjoys breaking 
things on his face. His hard, dark orbs dart to and fro while he 
delivers a good news/bad news proposition. The good news is 
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld will be visiting the 
detainees' Camp X-Ray the next morning. The bad news is that the 
unfounded rumor is founded--the Pentagon press corps is coming 
with him, and we'll be forced to leave a day early.

  Immediately, an angry media throng closes in on Costello, the 
air now containing an Altamont-like level of violence. "My 
editors are going to crush my nuts," says one reporter, probably 
female. "This is crazy," I say, "How am I supposed to get enough 
material for a piece?" "Not my problem," replies Costello. "This 
is bullshit," thunders another print reporter. "You're making us 
leave as the biggest story gets here." "You're not allowed to 
stay," says Costello. "Why not?" snaps the reporter. Costello's 
blood rises as his high-and-tight haircut stands up like an 
angry-dog scruff: "BECAUSE ... YOU'RE ... NOT ... STAYING!" 
"Welcome to the Pearl of the Antilles," deadpans Lt. Commander 
Brendan McPherson, in a limp cruise-director chirp.

  It's understandable if public affairs types are a little testy. 
There's an obvious culture clash (military personnel don't get 
paid to ask why; journalists don't get paid otherwise). Besides 
that, ever since the detainees started arriving on January 11, 
Gitmo and the joint forces being run under Southern Command have 
experienced the PR equivalent of what my ever-subtle 
colleagues--borrowing from Special Forces terminology for 
disastrous missions--call a "goat f--." In the richest irony of 
the war on terrorism, the Department of Defense, which normally 
goes out of its way not to make news, caused an international 
outcry by releasing still shots of detainees being brought to 
Camp X-Ray.

  As they were transported and in-processed, al Qaeda members were 
photographed kneeling, wearing earmuffs, shackles, and blackout 
goggles. Though these seemed perfectly reasonable precautions to 
take when transporting by C-141 members of an organization 
already responsible for one prison uprising (Mazar-i-Sharif, 
which resulted in a CIA operative's death) and several suicide 
plane crashes, human rights groups and international media, led 
by a chorus of Euro-whiners, immediately lapsed into hysterics.

  The British press, with typical understatement, claimed 
prisoners were being "brutalized, tortured, and humiliated," and 
that the whole operation was nothing more than "a sick attempt 
to appeal to the worst red-neck prejudices." Tony Blair pointed 
out that the three British al Qaeda members being held at Gitmo 
have had no complaints. But that didn't stop the Mirror's 
Stephen Moyes from method reporting by donning an al Qaeda rig. 
"Wrapped in the suffocating orange boiler suit," he wrote, "I 
lost any sense of dignity"--a loss he could have just as easily 
sustained by rereading his own copy.

  Sillier still were protestations from such humanitarians as 
Saddam Hussein and the government of Malaysia (Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad has made some of the loudest noise, though 
Amnesty International dings him for arresting the speechwriter 
of a political rival, who was then blindfolded, stripped naked, 
punched, verbally abused, and forced to simulate homosexual 
acts--none of which is alleged at Camp X-Ray). About the only 
foreign leader who has supported the American detainee camp, 
ironically, is Fidel Castro, who is either angling to end the 
embargo or inching ever closer to dementia. (He declared January 
"Americans' Month" and invited Jimmy Carter for a visit.)

  All of this has made Camp X-Ray personnel a sensitive lot. On 
the ferry crossing over to the windward side where the camp is 
located, I sit next to a now mellow Lt. Col. Costello, who has 
decided to patch things up with the reporter he snapped at, and 
who, after getting the sign-off from Southern Command, has 
cleared us to stay through Rumsfeld's visit. Costello, like many 
Gitmo types, is baffled at the uproar over the prisoners' 
treatment. "Soldiers and Marines that are guarding the detainees 
at Camp X-Ray have worse conditions than the detainees," he 
says. Much has been made over their being kept in outdoor cells, 
invariably called "cages," which are topped with corrugated 
tin-covered wooden roofs that keep what little rain Gitmo gets 
(six inches a year) off the prisoners. Costello says their 
eight-by-eight cells contain about twice as much space as 
soldiers have in their crowded, unventilated tents a few hundred 
yards away.

  "They're getting warm showers, clean laundry, hot chow," 
Costello says of the prisoners. "They're getting 2,600 calories 
a day. I'm not getting 2,600 calories a day. I'm running my ass 
off chasing you guys around." (One of the medics treating 
detainees claims that a full quarter of them were suffering from 
malnutrition when they were captured.)

  But we don't have to take Costello's word for it. We can see for 
ourselves, sort of. After a quick stop at McDonald's (the only 
one in Cuba), our white school bus transports us past beautiful 
seaside vistas and brownish cactus-infested scrub, past 
ramshackle housing and up a hill, which features an abandoned 
auto yard that the locals used to call Sears. It's where they'd 
strip old junkers for parts then used on jerry-rigged jalopies 
called "Gitmo specials."

  Across from Sears is Camp X-Ray, a teeming hive of concertina 
wire, canvas tents, guard towers, and newly constructed plywood 
interrogation shacks with window-unit air conditioners. The 
chain-link cells themselves don't need air conditioning, since a 
comfortable Caribbean breeze (temperatures range from the low 
70s at night to the low 80s during the day) continuously 
circulates through the encampment.

  Restricted to an area about 150 yards away from the open-air 
cellblocks, we observe the camp from a slight elevation that 
CNN's John Zarrella calls "Heartbreak Ridge," so named "because 
if you're a journalist, it breaks your heart that you can't get 
closer." Gitmo has actually been the site of a lot of heartbreak 
over the years.

  It broke Christopher Columbus's, when he stopped here on his 
second New World voyage. He left after failing to find gold, 
threatening to cut off the tongues of his crew if they didn't 
agree to pretend they'd reached Asia. It also rankles Castro, 
who has wanted to throw us off the island for four decades, but 
can't because of a pre-Revolution lease agreement. Likewise, 
when thousands of Cuban rafters were detained here for months in 
the mid-'90s, many grew so unhappy with Gitmo's ghostly 
desolation that they'd do anything to leave, including inject 
diesel fuel into their veins, drive tent stakes into their 
limbs, even swim back to Castro's Cuba.

  By comparison, the al Qaedans look pretty fat, if not happy. 
They laze away in the shade of their cells. They sleep on 
inch-and-a-half-thick isomats, the same ones that are issued to 
our military. With the assistance of a Muslim Navy chaplain, 
they pray five times daily. (Quick studies, the al Qaedans 
didn't need arrows painted on their cell floors. A single 
signpost next to an American flag points the way to Mecca.) And 
while American prisoners in the Hanoi Hilton often spent years 
in solitary confinement and received no medical care (John 
McCain to this day can't comb his own hair), X-Ray detainees get 
daily sick calls from all manner of doctors, from optometrists 
to podiatrists. The prisoners (who represent about 25 different 
nationalities but mostly are Saudis) can also freely chat with 
each other about God knows what: prison uprisings, the demise of 
Talk magazine, trades of Froot Loops for garlic bagel chips.

  Their restroom arrangements are pretty spartan. They get a white 
bucket for emergency squirts, while they are instructed to hold 
two fingers up for the alternative. At that time, a guard 
shackles them and takes them to the port-o-loo. While the 
military has spared no expense in construction costs (in three 
weeks, they built a completely operational field hospital 
staffed by 160 medical personnel--two more than there are 
prisoners), they've saved a fortune in toilet paper. It's the 
detainees' cultural preference not to use any. "We don't shake 
their hands," says one camp guard.

  In addition to the aforementioned amenities, detainees also 
receive two towels, a Koran, a shortened toothbrush (still long 
enough to file into a shiv), a canteen, a bucket of water, 
fluoride toothpaste, and shampoo. Not just any shampoo, but 
"Lively" salon anti-dandruff shampoo--a "luxurious shampoo in a 
gentle formula that restores moisture, shine, and body to your 
beautifully clean hair." Those who think the prisoners are 
getting coddled (Rep. John Mica, a Florida Republican, visited 
the camp and said it's "too good for the bastards") will be 
happy to know that the shampoo is not jojoba-enriched.

  WHILE public affairs officers these days are going to great 
lengths to talk about how docile the prisoners are, detainees 
have been reported biting a guard, spitting, and threatening to 
kill Americans. When I skirt away from my minders and visit the 
Marine snipers' tent, I learn it went well beyond that.

  The snipers, of course, are the camp's deadliest sharpshooters, 
ropy young bucks (21-23 years of age) who seem largely culled 
from the western or southern United States, where firearms are 
often regarded as extra appendages. Their tent looks like a 
Marines-issued college dorm room: Skoal-juice bottles, laundry 
hanging everywhere, and a spade-like sniper insignia banner 
tacked to a tent wall. If there is a prison uprising, it is 
these gentleman who will man the guard towers and introduce the 
rioters to their 72 black-eyed virgins.

  At some point, that might become necessary, they tell me, as 
plotting is obviously afoot. Sgt. Matt Lampert of Montana says 
the other day one of the prisoners was caught "with a piece of 
cloth stuffed with rocks that was tied off at the end." Sgt. 
Rodney Davis says that during chowtime, he sees them through his 
scope "making terrain models out of their food." And unlike say, 
Afghan prisons, where starving detainees are reportedly begging 
to be sent to Gitmo, there's plenty of food to play with. "They 
get fed better than us, sir," says Lampert. When I ask the 
Marines if they've seen anything weird, they laugh sheepishly, 
looking at each other. Finally, Sgt. Josh Westbrook, who sports 
a forearm tattoo of flaming baby heads, steps up. "They know 
they're being watched," he explains, "so they'll stare at you, 
and while they stare at you, they'll, uh, masturbate."

  According to these Marines, they don't just pleasure themselves 
to freak out the snipers, but also to embarrass the female Army 
guards in the camp's interior. The weirdness doesn't end there. 
They've also eaten their toiletries and urinated on equipment. 
"The other day," says Westbrook, "one of the guys tried to do a 
naked cartwheel." In the most bizarre twist, Lance Corporal 
Devin Klebaur says a few have also been known to "put toothpaste 
in their ass." "What's the purpose?" I ask. "I'm not sure," he 
says, puzzled.

  After leaving the snipers, I collar other grunts who say they 
believe the prisoners are more apt to act out whenever they see 
one of the regular visitors from the International Committee of 
the Red Cross enter the camp. "They're looking to be 
disciplined," says one, so that any aggressive guard behavior 
will make it look as if they're being brutalized by the American 
military in front of international witnesses. ICRC visits, says 
another soldier, are the highlight of a prisoner's day, since 
they've been spotted "giving the unshackled prisoners cookies 
and milk, cigarettes, shaking their hands." Many organizations 
who haven't been to Gitmo, like Human Rights Watch, have been 
extremely critical of the prisoners' treatment, while the ICRC 
has aired no complaints. Still, says another soldier, "They're a 
pain in the ass. We see them offering them cookies, hugging them 
like they're best buddies. They're undermining everything we're 
trying to do."

  What we're trying to do isn't exactly clear at this point. We 
are certainly interrogating the prisoners, though base sources 
won't divulge any information that's been gleaned. The prisoners 
will likely be formally charged and tried, though when I called 
a senior Pentagon source to find out by whom and when, the 
source said, "If you find out, will you please tell me?"

  ON SUNDAY, Rumsfeld visits, and we hope for illumination. 
Sitting on a bus on the tarmac, waiting for the secretary to 
emerge from his plane, we pass the time as journalists do, 
discussing the AP-style spelling of "bin Laden," speculating 
whether the prisoners will get an Internet cafe (one of them has 
asked for video games), and making fun of the fresh-meat 
Pentagon press corps, who are overdressed in heavy wools instead 
of our much cooler island linens.

  One of Rumsfeld's security agents mounts our bus, telling us the 
ground rules: no photos on the tarmac, no fighting, no hitting 
Rumsfeld in the head with a boom mike. After Rumsfeld tours Camp 
X-Ray with four senators and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, Richard Myers (who is so overshadowed by the secretary's 
rock star aura that one reporter has to ask who he is), Rumsfeld 
meets the press on Heartbreak Ridge. He gives the sort of hooah 
performance that has endeared him to both the troops and the 
press. While he remains as firm as ever that the detainees are 
"illegal combatants," not "prisoners of war," which would afford 
them more rights under the Geneva Convention, he nicely avoids 
plucking the only hair worth splitting--whether the captives' 
status is his call. (Human rights hawks say the matter should be 
decided by a "competent tribunal," whatever that is.)

  Even if it isn't up to Rumsfeld, the argument seems rather 
academic. It's hard to imagine anyone who has actually read the 
Geneva Convention wanting to confer POW status on alleged al 
Qaeda members. Doing so would not only make the terrorists 
eligible for repatriation to their home countries, but also 
would forbid their being punished for trying to escape, allow 
them to receive "scientific equipment" from home, and even 
confer upon them the right to dentures--in case they lost their 
teeth while, say, biting a guard. Most ludicrous, they would be 
afforded "advances of pay" in an amount "never ... inferior" to 
that which we pay our own armed forces. If you're a terrorist 
from Central Asia, it's not a bad deal: Kill Americans, get 
arrested, then get a pay raise from America.

  With all the global bellyaching about the detainees' right to 
humane treatment, it's hard to imagine them getting better 
treatment than they're already receiving. On my last day at 
Gitmo, all I have time to eat is a stale Ding Dong and a greasy 
plate of onion rings. My public affairs keepers couldn't care 
less. By contrast, for breakfast and lunch alone, the prisoners 
are served oatmeal, an orange, peanut butter, margarine, a 
"culturally appropriate" halal meal, and a giant snack pack 
containing Froot Loops, raisins, a Nature Valley granola bar, 
baked garlic bagel chips, and Bullseye barbecue-seasoned 
sunflower kernels. Still, the overseers of the prison are 
concerned that detainees aren't getting enough pita bread with 
their meals, and they're planning to make the food spicier, just 
the way the prisoners like it back home.

  While we wait, we journalists have to stand in the hot sun most 
of the day. After hours, we are confined to our Consolidated 
Bachelor Quarters, sleeping four to a duplex room on cots, some 
without pillows or blankets. We aren't even allowed to go the 
beach, a few hundred yards away from our building (though, 
emboldened by the rum we imported from Puerto Rico, a colleague 
and I make a mad dash under a guard searchlight for the 
bathwater Caribbean anyway). Besides drinking, our only 
entertainment is a pool table--one cue is cracked, the other is 
missing its tip. The prisoners, by contrast, get to read their 
Korans, while novels and more "religious books" are on the way.

  At the end of their day, they get a good night's sleep in a 
single cell. At the end of our day, we are told that a C-141 
(the same plane that transported the detainees) just became 
available, and we are prematurely hustled off so the military 
can dump us in Nowheresville, New Jersey, on a Sunday night 
after every rental car place in the state has closed.

  Perhaps the international community is right. The treatment 
being meted out at Guantanamo is inhumane. To see for yourself, 
don't bother canvassing Camp X-Ray prisoners. Just get a Gitmo 
press pass.

   Tokyo irked by US stance on Kyoto

 



  TOKYO - Coral reefs will die from water that's too hot. Polar 
bears will have less room to roam, crowding some of them out of 
existence. Birds will start flying an extra mile north each 
year, and may starve when they get there.

  These are among the dire possible consequences of global 
warming, say climate-change experts. At no time was it clearer 
that countries should take steps to slow this process than when 
150 countries signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997.

  But now, with President George Bush saying the US will not 
ratify the protocol - which was shaped in part to fit 
Washington's concerns five years ago - the accord's ultimate 
effectiveness is in doubt, and many US allies are irritated.

  For Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, the shaping of the accord 
on their soil was a source of pride - and proof that they were 
still relevant players on the world stage.

  "It is absolutely inadmissible for the US, which is the greatest 
gas-emitting country, to once again turn its back and present 
something that is against Kyoto Protocol and the framework 
convention on climate change," says Mie Asaoka, president of the 
Kiko Network, a Tokyo environmental-umbrella organization 
representing about 150 Japanese groups.

  The clash over how to stop global warming while allowing 
sluggish economies to prosper occurs at an awkward point in 
US-Japanese relations. US analysts looking east say that as 
Japan's economic dominance in Asia diminishes, so will the 
importance of the US-Japan relationship as a whole.

  The US Department of Defense recently left Japan off its list of 
nations contributing to the post-Sept. 11 war on terror. 
Realizing the accidental slight, the US later apologized for 
overlooking Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's efforts - 
considered tremendously ambitious here - to alter the 
interpretation of Japan's post-World War II pacifist 
constitution in order to dispatch warships for noncombat 
support.

  During Mr. Bush's visit here last month, Mr. Koizumi gently 
balked at the president's proposed alternative to the Kyoto 
agreement, saying that Japan would "like to see further efforts" 
on the part of the US.

  While there are no protesters in the streets, there is an air of 
indignation here over Washington's "do-it-our-way" decision on 
something that effects the whole globe.

  Among the Kiko Network's handouts is a pamphlet with a cartoon 
of the world. On one end, Koizumi defensively holds up the Kyoto 
Protocol. On the other, a fiendish-looking Bush seizes a weeping 
globe in his monster-size hands.

  In the eyes of Japan and many US allies, the Bush 
administration's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol is 
one of many signals that Washington is growing increasingly 
unilateralist in the six months since the Sept. 11 attacks on 
America. From pulling out of Kyoto - which is in the process of 
being ratified by the European Union - to labeling Iran, Iraq, 
and North Korea an "axis of evil" and prime targets in the next 
phase of the war, America's allies are seeing in the US a 
growing tendency to act first and consult later.

  The Bush administration is offering its own alternative plan, 
the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, which 
aides say are more market-sensitive and will reduce the worst 
air pollutants by 70 percent while finding a strategy to cut 
greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent over the next 10 years.

  But environmental advocates say Bush's alternative will allow 
the US to continue to increase the amount of gas it emits. They 
fear that, because the US is forging its own way, smaller 
nations that are expected to ratify the Kyoto Protocol could 
start backing out. This could lead to a two-tier system in which 
the US and a few others - Australia and Canada may follow suit - 
will choose their own targets, while the rest of the world will 
be limited to the stricter Kyoto limits.

  
Not everyone in Japan is upset with Bush's alternative.

  Japanese industry has already gone through vigorous 
energy-saving - and thus environmentally friendly - drives after 
the two energy crises of the 1970s and 1980s, says Mitsuru 
Shinozaki, a spokesman for Keidanren, the country's most 
influential business lobby. After the Earth Summit of 10 years 
ago, he says, Japan discussed and implemented a self-action plan 
to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. "Any further policy to 
reduce emissions," he says "will hurt Japanese industrial 
competitiveness."

   Not 'gonna be a long, long time' till you can be a rocket man

 



  The International Space Station is not exactly the 
Waldorf-Astoria. And a Russian Soyuz capsule will never boast 
the creature comforts of a stretch limo.

  But that doesn't bother an increasing number of well-heeled 
executives and celebrities willing to pay millions of dollars 
and spend a few months training in exchange for a quick trip to 
orbit.

  Welcome to the dawn of space tourism, where opportunities to 
view spaceship Earth from aboveare rare, visions of the future 
are grand, and Everyman seems willing to shed planet Earth, if 
briefly. The latest "tour-o-naut" to buckle up and place his 
tray table in the upright, locked position is South African 
venture capitalist Mark Shuttleworth. He launched with two 
cosmonauts on a space-station resupply flight yesterday from the 
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. He is the second fare-paying 
visitor to the station, following in the bootsteps of Dennis 
Tito, a US businessman who took that same trip last year.

  They aren't alone. "Another eight to 10 people have expressed 
interest" in a Soyuz trip to the space station, notes Tereza 
Predescu of Space Adventures, an Arlington, Va., company that 
arranges the flights.

  
'N space?

  Russia's next resupply flight is scheduled for October, and two 
Americans are vying for the passenger seat: former National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration associate administrator 
Lori Garver and boy-band 'N Sync's Lance Bass. Aerosmith rocker 
Steven Tyler also is reportedly eyeing a future flight.

  "There is a lot of pent-up demand, at least emotionally" among a 
large number of people to journey into space, says John Logsdon, 
of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University in 
Washington, D.C.

  For example, in 2000, Harris Interactive surveyed Americans' and 
Canadians' willingness to travel into space as tourists. 
Overall, 86 percent of the 2,022 respondents would be interested 
in a trip to space. Extrapolating from the results, Space 
Adventures, which commissioned the study, estimates that 10,000 
people a year would be willing to pay $100,000 apiece for a 
quick up-and-down suborbital flight, a la Mercury astronaut Alan 
Shepard. That translates into a $1 billion-a-year business.

  If they received the trip as a promotion or gift, 80 percent of 
the respondents said they'd take an intercontinental 
space-plane, 70 percent would take a space-station tour or an 
orbital flight, and 74 percent would be willing to take a 
suborbital journey.

  For space tourism to truly take off, however, several things 
must happen, says Frank Sietzen of the Space Transportation 
Association, an aerospace-industry group in Arlington, Va.

  "You need a strong, growing US space transportation system, and 
the federal ... decision that it's in the national interest to 
fund ... a second generation reusable launch vehicle to supplant 
the shuttle at a sufficiently low cost that it would be 
commercially viable," he says. Out of that effort would come the 
rocket or rockets that would service commercial passenger 
flights.

  He likens the effort needed to one the US Air Force undertook in 
1951, when it began developing an aerial tanker to refuel jet 
fighters and bombers. The result, he continues, was the KC-135, 
known commercially as the Boeing 707, the first commercial jet 
to be used worldwide.

  The government is moving in that direction with NASA's Space 
Launch Initiative. The agency has budgeted $4.8 billion through 
2006 for the development of safer, more reliable, and cheaper 
follow-ons to the shuttle. It looking beyond the SLI to a 
program designed to develop a third-generation of launch 
vehicles.

  Others are not waiting for the government to act. Some 20 
companies and groups worldwide are in a competition for a $10 
million purse offered to the first firm that can build and fly a 
two-stage, reusable rocket that can carry three people on a 
suborbital flight and be refurbished for its next flight within 
two weeks. Yesterday, a Canadian team paraded a mockup a 
60-foot-long "Canadian Arrow" through the streets of Manhattan 
in a pitch coinciding with Mr. Shuttleworth's launch.

  Known as the X Prize, the contest is modeled after the prizes 
that stimulated growth of commercial aviation early in the last 
century, says X Prize Foundation president Peter Diamandis.

  
Modern barnstormers

  Noting that Charles Lindbergh's record-breaking trans-Atlantic 
solo flight was a response to the offer of an aviation prize, he 
adds that within six years of that flight, commercial passenger 
flights became common. He expects a similar commercial response 
after his prize is issued.

  "People paid what for them were large sums of money" to fly with 
early-20th century barnstormers "to see the world from 2,000 
feet," he says. He expects a similar response when an X Prize 
winner emerges. Indeed, Space Adventures already has payments 
from roughly 100 customers willing to fly with astronautical 
barnstormers once a winner emerges, perhaps as early as 2004 or 
2005.

  The contest already is stimulating a range of related efforts, 
ranging from states trying to set up space ports for tourism 
flights, to Federal Aviation Administration development of 
licensing requirements for private commercial launch facilities 
and passenger operations.

  Where Dr. Diamandis sees relatively short-term opportunity, 
however, others suggest a viable space-tourism industry is still 
a decade or more away. "It will happen," he says, "but not in 
the time frame that will please tourism's advocates."

   Veni, Vidi, Venezuela

 



  FIGHTING tyranny with tyranny clearly didn't work in oil-giant 
Venezuela last week. And now coup-plotting military officers and 
the reinstalled president, Hugo Chavez, need to show Latin 
America that their tyrannical tactics are at an end.

  President Chavez - a former Army coup-meister himself, who was 
elected three years ago - has abused his popular mandate with 
heavy-handed measures based on a Constitution largely rewritten 
by himself and his supporters. He has sometimes talked of 
remaining president past the year 2020. And his economic 
promises to the poor are in shreds, while his diplomatic 
flirtation with leftist world dictators only hints at his 
inclinations to gain more power.

  But Latin America has moved beyond coups, and this pivotal 
nation in a hemisphere of democracies has the means to remove 
Mr. Chavez by constitutional and especially nonviolent means.

  His two-day removal from office began when he tried to stack the 
board of the state-owned oil company in his favor. The company's 
executives revolted, threatening a cutoff of oil. That was a 
catalyst for pent-up opposition to Chavez. Business groups and 
labor unions joined in a giant protest, perhaps knowing that 
portions of the military were on their side. When gunshots were 
fired during a march on the presidential palace last Thursday, 
killing more than a dozen, military leaders forced Chavez to 
step aside. But then international pressure and renewed domestic 
support for Chavez forced the generals to let him take office 
again.

  The Bush administration all but welcomed the coup, tarnishing 
the US role as a champion of democracy. It, too, has a reason to 
repent.

   Venezuela's new dawn

 



  
BBC correspondent in Caracas

  Venezuelans awoke on Friday to a country transformed by the 
dramatic and violent events of the last 24 hours, which left at 
least 11 people dead and more than 80 injured.

  A general strike and an escalating oil industry stoppage that 
had threatened to cripple the country's economy were no more - 
and the country not only had a new president, business leader 
Pedro Carmona, but a new name.

  The country was no longer the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 
in honour of South American independence hero Simon Bolivar, one 
of former president Hugo Chavez's heroes.

  Now it is simply the Republic of Venezuela. The name change was 
Mr Carmona's first act as head of the transition government.

  His second was to announce the end of the three-day general 
strike he had called with the head of the Confederation of 
Venezuelan Workers (CTV) leader Carlos Ortega in support of 
protesting managers from state oil company PDVSA.

  
Shellshocked

  Managers were striking because Mr Chavez had filled the 
company's board of directors with his supporters.

  Despite the announcement, traffic was lighter than a normal 
Friday and many Venezuelans did not turn up for work.

  The country is in shellshock. On Thursday a peaceful rally of 
more than 100,000 mainly middle class Venezuelans had ended in 
bloodshed.

  As marchers called for Mr Chavez's resignation outside 
Miraflores, the presidential palace, shots were fired into the 
crowd. Eyewitness Euridice Ledesma said snipers fired on the 
marchers from rooftops near the palace.

  Film footage also caught armed supporters of Mr Chavez firing 
indiscriminately at the marchers.

  Later army chief, General Efrain Vasquez said some "Bolivarian" 
groups were indeed armed.

  "It was horrible. These groups were shooting at defenceless 
people," said photographer Luis Gomez.

  
Chavez's last day

  At the time, Mr Chavez was addressing the nation to assure them 
his government respected people's right to demonstrate and 
freedom of the press.

  Moments later he announced that he had taken five national 
television channels off the air for "telling lies about the 
government".

  The shootings were the final straw for the military. A 
succession of officers filled the TV screens to say they 
supported the people and that the killings were "not tolerable".

  As tanks surrounded Miraflores, Mr Chavez was holed up with 
senior military officers in a bid to save his presidency.

  In the early hours of the morning, chief of the armed forces 
General Lucas Rincon held a brief news conference to say Mr 
Chavez's resignation had been demanded and accepted.

  Earlier his wife, Marisabel, and children had left Caracas in 
the cover of darkness on a PDVSA jet for Barquisimeto in western 
Venezuela.

  Mr Chavez is currently detained at Fuerte Tiuna army base in 
Caracas and could face possible charges for his role in the 
killings.

  News of Mr Chavez's resignation caused hundreds of flag-waving 
and whistle-blowing Venezuelans to surround the city's air force 
base, La Carlota, in the hope of seeing Mr Chavez' departure 
from the country.

  Mr Chavez's exit has left Venezuela with a power vacuum and no 
obvious long-term leader. The challenge now is to heal the deep 
social divisions that exist within the country.

  "I think people are happy because Chavez has fallen. But there's 
also a feeling of uncertainty about how the country's obvious 
problems are going to be solved," said Ms Ledesma.

US Secretary of State Colin Powell, described as one of the few enlightened officials in President Bush's administration, is trying to "patch up" President Bush's statements, especially his latest one in which he made reckless threats at the "axis of evil," namely Iran, Iraq and North Korea. A day after President Bush's threat to crush these countries and use all means to prevent them from developing weapons of mass destruction, Secretary Powell said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that "characterizing these counties as the axis of evil does not mean that his government intends to invade them." He added: "We are prepared to initiate a dialogue, and we want to work with our friends and allies in the world on ways of dealing with such regimes." 
	
	
 These are fine words, but they do not reflect the reality, because the hard-line wing in the US administration comprising Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice have the final say in running affairs at the White House, and have direct influence on President Bush. 
	
	
 Oddly enough, speculations swirled in Washington that Powell listened to President Bush's speech and his threats to "the axis of evil" like any other US citizen. He had not read the speech before President Bush delivered it, as he was supposed to do by virtue of his post. The fact that he subsequently denied these speculations does not mean they are baseless. 
	
	
 At any rate, Secretary Powell's remark about the US administration's readiness to enter dialogue with these "evil" states and with Washington's friends on ways of dealing with them involves some contradictions. For he affirmed in the first speech that there would be no dialogue with Iraq until after it has accepted the return of the UN arms inspectors. 
	
	
 The current US administration will consult with no one, not even its closest allies, whether in Europe or its followers in the Third World, particularly in the Arab world. The US administration has already decided to "punish" any country it believes poses a danger to the Hebrew State. It lumped North Korea with Iran and Iraq as part of the "axis of evil" only to mislead Arabs and Muslims and to create the impression that Islam is not alone targeted. 
	
	
 The United States is these days ruled by an alliance between two main lobbies, the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby, which sees the world through the eyes of Ari'el Sharon and his extremist government. We therefore have to expect the worst in the near future. 
	
	
 President Bush is facing a recession and an economic crisis. He does not want to repeat his father's mistake, being defeated in the next elections because of economic factors. He is therefore planning to trigger wars here and there to revive the flagging arms industry. 
	
	
 The United States is currently run by a typical Texan mentality, which is closer to that of cowboys than to a civilized mentality that believes in dialogue and coexistence among peoples. This mentality simultaneously raises apprehensions and resentment, because international economic prosperity can be built on stability, not wars. A catastrophe would engulf every country if the US arms industry progressed at the expense of the world's security and stability.

 Kitakyushu, Japan, Feb. 12 Kyodo -- A 3,986-ton Panamanian cargo ship heading to Taiwan from South Korea sank in the East China Sea late Monday, leaving one sailor dead and another of the 20-member crew missing, the Japan Coast Guard said Tuesday. 
	
	
 Coast Guard officials said the vessel, Triumph Kaohsiung, sank at around 11:30 p.m. at a point about 110 kilometers west of Goto islands in western Nagasaki Prefecture. 
	
	
 Officials said 19 crew members were plucked up from the sea and one died later. 
	
	
 According to the Triumph Kaohsiung crew, the vessel was flooded with water and the engine stopped at around 7 p.m. Monday, and the ship sank four and a half hours later. 
	
	
 The ship was heading to the southern Taiwan city Kaohsiung with a cargo of steel products that was loaded in the South Korean port Pohang. 
	
	
 Coast Guard officials said Japanese coast guard vessels plucked 12 survivors from a lifeboat and seven others from the sea. One of the rescued sailors died later. 
	
	
 Japanese coast guard aircraft and patrol boats were in the area looking for the missing sailor. 
	
	
 The ship's crew consisted of 11 Chinese, one Taiwanese, two Indonesians and six Myanmarese.	


	
United Nations, New York, Nov 11, IRNA -- President Mohammad Khatami and his Venezuelan counterpart Hugo Chavez here Saturday cited cooperation among OPEC member countries as the key to forestalling further oil price declines. The Iranian president also hailed Chavez's recent efforts in travelling to OPEC and non-OPEC member countries, in a bid to garner support for propping up the sagging crude prices. Khatami, who had met with Chavez on the sidelines of a UN General Assembly session, also explained the ongoing Afghan crisis in the wake of the US-led strikes as well as the Islamic Republic's stance on the September 11 terror attacks in Washington and New York. He reiterated his call for a global peace coalition, based on justice, to stem the roots of terrorism. "Forming a world-wide coalition based on peace and justice to eradicate the ominous phenomenon of terrorism is a must," Khatami said. Chavez, whose country currently heads the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said that Venezuela's recent efforts in the form of his whirlwind trips to OPEC and non-OPEC member countries, were in line with the interests of all the oil producing countries. He also described cooperation among OPEC and non-OPEC countries as a boost to their national interests. Chavez voiced "the Latin American concern" on the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, saying Caracas was following the international stance on the fight against terrorism, violence and intrigues. OPEC is due to hold a meeting in Vienna on Wednesday to discuss the widely expected production cut. He also called for further expansion of bilateral cooperation between Tehran and Caracas in various international fields, such as OPEC and the Group of 77 (G77) of the world developing countries. Khatami is currently in New York to attend a special session of the UN General Assembly on 'Dialogue Among Civilizations' to have an international convention on the theme approved. The United Nations designated 2001, as the Year of 'Dialogue among Civilizations' on President Khatami's initiative.	


	
KABUL, Feb 10 (AFP) - Interim Afghan leader Hamid Karzai is to travel to the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, completing visits to the three countries that recognized the Taliban regime before September 11. 
	
	
 Kabul announced the Afghan embassy in Islamabad would reopen next week after Karzai's historic fence-mending visit to Pakistan on Friday. He has also made an official trip to Saudi Arabia. 
	
	
 In another step to heal festering wounds, Karzai on Saturday pardoned 350 captured Taliban soldiers, saying they were "innocent" and part of a general amnesty that allowed foot-soldiers to go free. 
	
	
 But the Afghan interim government branded Mullah Abdul Wakil Mutawakel, the Taliban foreign minister who surrendered to US forces in Kandahar Friday, as a war criminal who should be put on trial. 
	
	
 Taliban leaders "created misery for our people. The world has suffered because of what they did ... They deserve justice and to be treated as war criminals because they supported terrorism," Interim Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah said. 
	
	
 One of the closest aides to reclusive Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, he is seen as a potential source of crucial evidence against Omar and bin Laden, the chief suspect of the September 11 terror attacks who has eluded a US-led manhunt so far. 
	
	
 The United States meanwhile brought another 34 al-Qaeda and Taliban captives to a detention camp on a US naval base on Cuba Saturday, bringing the total of detainees held there to 220. 
	
	
 The new arrivals were dressed in standard-issue zippered orange jumpsuits. Because each was bound and shackled, the blue jackets they wore on the 27-hour flight were removed by scissors-wielding US troops as the prisoners descended from the plane into the tropical heat. 
	
	
 In Geneva the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it and Washington were at odds over Washington's decision not to recognise captured Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters as prisoners of war. 
	
	
 "There are divergent views between the US and the ICRC on the procedures which apply on how to determine that the persons detained are not entitled to prisoner of war status," the ICRC said in a statement. 
	
	
 "The US and the ICRC will pursue their dialogue on this issue." 
	
	
 US President George W. Bush decided Thursday that the 1949 Geneva Conventions would apply to captured Taliban fighters taken from Afghanistan to a US military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but not to al-Qaeda members there. 
	
	
 However, Washington said that neither group would be accorded prisoner of war status. 
	
	
 Concern also continued over signs that the US was expanding its war on terror to other countries. 
	
	
 While taking care to avoid directly criticizing Bush, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said it was unrealistic to see the world in terms of good and evil states. 
	
	
 In an interview published by the Swiss daily newspaper Blick on Saturday, Annan was asked about Bush's statement describing Iran, Iraq and North Korea as part of an "axis of evil." 
	
	
 Annan said, without specifically mentioning the US: "You can not divide the world between the good and the evil, because between them there are shades of gray." 
	
	
 EU commissioner Chris Patten, also speaking in a newspaper interview, accused Bush's administration of a dangerously "absolutist and simplistic" stance. 
	
	
 It was time European governments spoke up and stopped Washington before it went into "unilateralist overdrive", he told the British newspaper The Guardian. 
	
	
 In Ottawa, the Group of Seven industrialized nations called for intensified efforts to freeze terrorist financing and reported that at least 100 million dollars had been frozen since September 11. 
	
	
 "Significant results have already been achieved," said the final communique of finance ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. 
	
	
 "Since September 11, almost 150 countries and jurisdictions have issued orders to freeze terrorist assets and over 100 million dollars has been frozen worldwide," it said after the two-day gathering in Ottawa and in nearby Quebec. 
	
	
 In another sign of progress in cracking terrorist networks, court sources in Paris said an Islamic militant under investigation for an alleged plot to attack the French city of Strasbourg had admitted meeting two other terrorist suspects at a training camp in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 Yacine Akhnouche, arrested Monday, told police he had met suspected shoe bomber Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui at a training camp in Afghanistan in 2000, during one of several stays in the country. 
	
	
 Moussaoui, a Frenchman of Moroccan descent, is the first person charged in connection with the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. 
	
	
 Reid, a British national, was arrested after allegedly trying to light a fuse attached to explosives in his shoes while on a Paris to Miami flight on December 22. 
	
	
 Karzai meanwhile continued to wrestle with security problems as rival warlords tried to fill the power vacuum left by the fall of the Taliban. 
	
	
 On Saturday he met representatives of two warlords who clashed violently last week over who should be governor in eastern Paktia province. 
	
	
 "This is a very serious matter and Karzai wanted himself to be involved in finding a solution," Deputy Border Affairs Minister Mirza Ali told AFP. 
	
	
 Fifty people were killed in a two-day battle when Karzai's appointed governor, Padsha Khan, sent his forces to secure the governor's house in the provincial capital Gardez. 
	
	
 They were driven out by rival warlord Saif Ullah, who has refused to give up power. 
	
	
 Karzai has blamed Khan for the fighting and said it was "one more reason why we should finish warlordism in this country." 
	
	
 The clash has called into question Karzai's ability to govern beyond the Kabul area and bolstered his appeal for the deployment of more international troops in his country. 
	
	
 The search for kidnapped US journalist Daniel Pearl stretched into its 18th day in Pakistan with no sign of the Wall Street Journal correspondent, who was abducted while researching a story on Islamic militancy. 
	
	
	


	
Following the end of the Cold War, the United States has become the world's sole superpower and the trend of pragmatism in its foreign policy has become clearer and clearer. Pragmatism is, in the first place, the United States' traditional policy. After coming to power, unilateralism and pragmatism have become Bush's main foreign policy line. Alternate use of and complementary nature of pragmatism and unilateralism constitute the characteristics of the Bush administration's diplomacy. 
	
	
 Once coming to power, Bush insisted on deploying the National Missile Defense System [NMD]. The international community and even US western allies, including US neighbor Canada, have consistently opposed the plan. Despite the opposition, Bush went it alone. One of the main US diplomatic goals for this year is to persuade the international community to accept the NMD and Russia to agree to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty [AMD] by flashing a carrot on a stick. At one time, he said the new US missile defense system would not pose a threat to the international security and would not trigger an arms race; on another occasion, he stated the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1972 was "a product of the Cold War era," and thus has lost its binding force. He even claimed that to develop the NMD, the United States would be even prepared to scrap the ABM. Over the past year, Bush increased funds for research and testing for the N!
MD and accelerated the test frequency of the anti-missile system. Even after the adoption of the resolution on "maintaining and abiding by the "Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty" on 29 November at the 56th United Nations General Assembly, the United States still persisted in carrying out a fifth missile interception test. In a word, the US development of the NMD is for the purpose of "attacking other countries and at the same time preventing other countries from attacking it," thereby genuinely securing its status of being the "sole super power." 
	
	
 The Sino-US plane collision event that occurred on 1 April can best illustrate the US alternate application of the "two-isms" in its diplomacy. In the plane collision event, if one goes by the US logic, only the US spy plane is permitted to spy at other people's doorsteps; the host, on the other hand, does not even have the right to look after its doors and to protect its yard. The responsibility for the event, in which a Chinese plane crashed and a Chinese pilot perished, lies completely with the US side. The US side not only refused to apologize to China but also claimed that "US crew members were detained by the Chinese side." It was only because of it being deterred by the Chinese Government's firm position and due to the fact that the US crew members were still in China that the United States was compelled to offer an apology. But after the Chinese side released all the US crew members, major US political figures changed their stance immediately and threatened to use human rights, trade, and Olympics hosting issues to "retaliate" against China. 
	
	
 Since coming to power, Bush, proceeding from the US immediate interests, has also adopted the pragmatism and unilateralism position with regard to international treaties. This March, catering to the interests of the US oil and coal barons who have made large political donations to the Republican Party, Bush announced, without prior consultations with its allies, that the United States would not enforce the "Kyoto Protocol" which is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the world. This announcement was met with unanimous condemnation by the international media. 
	
	
 In July, the Bush administration decided to let the "Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty" "freeze" in the Senate. Hard on the heels of that decision, the US negotiation representative Marie Chevrier announced in Geneva that the Bush administration would not support the implementation of the "Biological Weapons Convention" and that the United States strongly objected to the concrete enforcement plan of this convention. 
	
	
 The Bush administration either refuses to sign, ratify, or implement international treaties or asks for their revision. It only wants the international treaties that benefit the US security and economy and globalization. It does not want anything to do with the international treaties, mechanisms, and organizations that restrict or prevent US freedom. It does not want anything to do with countries and organizations that do not follow its orders or that always cause troubles to it. 
	
	
 After the 11 September attacks on the United States, the international community strongly condemned the terrorist acts and expressed sympathy and support to the American people. Supported by the world, the United States launched the "war against terrorism" of this century. Bush stressed that the war is not only the "US war" but also a "world war." The United States views itself as a "major force of anti-terrorism," for in the world only the United States has the capability to carry out the global war against terrorism. Bush said, "Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists" and "any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime." The United States wants all the countries in the world to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and decides which country is its enemy or friend on the basis of that country's attitude toward it. It is in fact like using multilateral diplomacy to enhance US unilateralism. But the United States obviously practices pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan -- a frontline state in the fight against Pakistan. Before the 11 September event, the United States kept its distance from Pakistan and imposed sanctions on it. But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it. Whether the United States will continue to treat Pakistan in a responsible manner, it is anybody's guess.

In an antiterrorist war that at the time was initially launched as Operation Infinite Justice, it is infinitely difficult to reconcile oneself to the pictures of chained and humiliated Taliban and al-Qaida prisoners at the U.S. Guantanamo base on Cuba. The pictures resemble an attempt to satisfy a primitive thirst for revenge and convince the Americans that the Bush administration has not only succeeded in removing a regime of religious madmen in out-of-the-way Afghanistan, but also in taking prisoner some of those responsible for the terrorist acts on that day in September. 
	
	
 The U.S. and most recently the British governments reject the suggestion that the prisoners are being harmed, but this does not alter the fact that the pictures of hooded prisoners in chains are in themselves enough to paint a picture of a United States that in the name of self-righteousness - and equally worryingly: without any great amount of debate - has allowed itself to infringe international rules. 
	
	
 This impression is reinforced by the fact that for the time being at least the United States has ignored the Geneva Convention and refused to treat those taken prisoner as prisoners of war - something to which they have a right - until a competent court has decided differently. 
	
	
 Instead the superpower has entered a legal fog where the prisoners have been stamped with a nonsense term in international law: "battlefield prisoners." As such they face the prospect of being subjected to the due course of law and in the final analysis perhaps sentenced to death in closed military courts instead of in open courts, as is the right of prisoners of war under the terms of the Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 For most people it will of course be difficult to mobilize any great degree of understanding for those responsible for the bloody terrorism in the United States on that day in September, but what is at issue here is that at the present moment principles are at stake that could have far-reaching repercussions for the future war against terrorism. 
	
	
 With its behavior, therefore, the United States is not only compromising the image of the war against terrorism as an expression of a higher form of justice, but also of itself as an unshakeable defender of this same justice. This will undoubtedly rub off on the superpower's allies, including Denmark. And for this reason, too, they have a moral duty to speak out, as Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh, among others, did yesterday. Otherwise they face the risk not only of undermining the legitimacy of their own antiterrorism war at present, but also of sending out a signal that despots around the world will know how to exploit. 
	
	
 Many of them have already demonstrated great skill in their own behavior when it comes to exploiting the West's fear of terrorism. 
	
	
	


	
As prisoners from Al-Qa'ida and Taliban are being transported to the cells of the US Guantanamo base in Cuba, the United States' war on terrorism enters a new stage that is completely different from that of armed confrontation in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 Amidst the heat of military battles in Afghanistan, and on the background of the double crime that hit the United States, international opinion is now willing to overlook some inhumane practices that were made on this or that front. However, the situation has changed fundamentally since the batches of Al-Qa'ida and Taliban prisoners started arriving one after the other to Guatanamo base shackled and caged in cages that are no longer than eight feet and wider than six. The attention of the world moved from Afghanistan to Cuba to follow what Amnesty International considers an "uncomfortable situation" for the detainees. This has prompted two of Washington's closest allies, Britain and Australia, to express their "concern" over the way the prisoners were transported from Afghanistan and the way they are being treated in captivity. 
	
	
 It is obvious that statements by US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that the detainees are "illegitimate fighters" upon home the Geneva convention on POW's does not apply have not helped alleviate world concern over the US abandoning its (until now) well-known commitment to the principles of justice in treating the Al-Qa'ida and Taliban prisoners. 
	
	
 The continued US ambiguity in using the title of prisoners, and specifically prisoners of war or "illegitimate" combatants, and the possibility of trying them in private and closed martial court, do not help the United States maintain international sympathy with its war. 
	
	
 As the campaign of Western criticism of the United States heightens, it has become urgent for Washington to clarify its stand on treating the prisoners and their destiny so that it would not be recorded in history that the number one democracy in the war won the war on terrorism in weeks and lost the reputation of commitment to principles of human justice that it took centuries to gain. 
	
	
	


	
Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Liberal Party) has voiced his approval of the U.S. treatment of the 144 al-Qaida prisoners at the U.S. Guantanamo military base on Cuba. 
	
	
 "The U.S. Government has announced that the United States will respect its international commitments," Fogh Rasmussen said at his weekly press conference on Tuesday [22 January]. 
	
	
 He points out that the United States has allowed the Red Cross to inspect conditions at the Guantanamo base. 
	
	
 Criticism From the Red Cross 
	
	
 He fails to mention, however, that on the international stage the Red Cross has subsequently criticized the U.S. treatment of prisoners. 
	
	
 EU foreign affairs spokesman Javier Solana, among others, has also criticized the United States for not recognizing the al-Qaida prisoners as prisoners of war as understood in the Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 The Swedish Government has also expressed concern about the prisoners' rights. 
	
	
 Fogh: They Must Be Given a Fair Trial 
	
	
 "The prisoners must be treated with respect for their integrity and religion, and they must be given a fair trial," Fogh Rasmussen says. 
	
	
 On Monday Liberal Party foreign affairs spokesman Troels Lund Poulsen said that the debate on prisoners' rights is "an intellectual discussion." 
	
	
 Per Stig Moller: Give Them Rights 
	
	
 Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller (Conservative People's Party) is urging the United States to guarantee the prisoners the status of prisoners of war and in consequence protection under the terms of the Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 "I expect the United States to satisfy the requirements of the international conventions," Per Stig Moller said at a press conference in Berlin on Monday. 
	
	
 " Social Democratic Party: Raise Denmark's Voice 
	
	
 The Social Democratic Party takes the view that the Danish Government should raise its voice against the United States. 
	
	
 "I do not have all the information, but there are some questionable aspects in the U.S. approach," political spokesman Mogens Lykketoft (Social Democratic Party) told Ritzau Bureau. 
	
	
 "Of course the United States has a point when it says that it can be difficult to decide who are terrorists and who are prisoners of war. We must focus on the treatment of them." 
	
	
 The Socialist People's Party is sending an "urgent call" to the government to deliver official criticism to the United States. 
	
	
 "It cannot be the duty of the Danish Government to applaud everything that the Americans do. Even though we support their action, we should criticize this form of treatment of prisoners," Socialist People's Party Chairman Holger K. Nielsen said. 
	
	
 He will now ask the foreign minister to give a written reply outlining the government's position on the issue. 
	
	
 Danish People's Party: Are They Danes? 
	
	
 The Danish People's Party sees no reason to criticize the United States. 
	
	
 "To begin with, I have great confidence that what the Americans are doing in relation to these prisoners is reasonable. I can imagine that the United States has had good reasons for transporting them to Cuba," foreign affairs spokesman Peter Skaarup (Danish People's Party) says. 
	
	
 As long as no Danes are involved, the Danish People's Party does not think that Denmark should interfere. 
	
	
 "This could of course become necessary if a Dane were involved. Otherwise it must be a matter between the United States and the countries which have citizens who are directly affected," Peter Skaarup said, alluding to the United Kingdom and Sweden. 
	
	
	


	
ANKARA, Dec 15 (A.A) - Interior Minister Rustu Kazim Yucelen released a decree on Saturday, and announced measures to be taken against illegal migration by sea. 
	
	
 The decree said that human smuggling incidents from the Turkish coasts to Greek islands, Italy and France increased recently due to economic, social and political reasons. 
	
	
 It said that the Coast Guard units had intercepted a total of 6 thousand 743 foreigners since January 1, 1996. 2,816 of these foreigners were captured in the first 11 months of 2001. 
	
	
 The Coast Guard Command has been working on a report to give detailed information about its activities against human smuggling and number of foreigners intercepted between January 1 and November 26, 2001. 
	
	
 According to the report, Turkish and Greek flagged ships, fishing boats and speed boats were used by human smugglers. 
	
	
 ``Most of the illegal migration incidents by sea happened in western provinces of Izmir, Aydin and Mugla. 28 out of 63 incidents were reported in Bodrum township of Mugla. These incidents generally increase in spring and fall. Turkish citizens from southern and southeastern provinces accounted for 31 percent. Iraqi and Afghan immigrants followed them. Having regard to the fact that 95.1 percent of foreign immigrants were coming from African and Middle Eastern countries, it becomes more difficult to prevent illegal migration from under developed countries to European countries via Turkey,`` it added.	


	
Spanish daily urges caution in judging USA's treatment of suspects 
	
	
 Text of unsigned editorial, "Treatment of the prisoners", by Spanish newspaper ABC web site on 22|January 
	
	
 The dissemination of some photos taken of a group of detainees in Guantanamo has aroused international controversy. Critics condemn the inhumane nature of the treatment the prisoners are receiving, handcuffed, immobilized with shackles, subjected to sensory deprivation and confined to minute cells. If these accusations are confirmed, the only possible definition will be torture and the violation of human rights. However, we may be witnessing a distortion of reality, and even in some cases pure falsehoods. The photos were sent voluntarily to the press by the American authorities, who clarified that they depicted a group of 20 dangerous prisoners who had recently arrived at the base and undergone a process of identification prior to their confinement. These were in no way their normal living conditions. But the decisive fact is the presence for days of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is preparing a report and which, as usual, has refused to make any statements. It will speak in its report. Herein lies the difference. In the countries in which torture is systematically carried out, for example Cuba or China, inspection by international organizations is not permitted. The result of the report will have to be taken into account before political and moral judgments of guilty or not guilty are made. For the time being, the members of the British government who interviewed three prisoners of their nationality have received no complaints about the treatment they are receiving. Indications exist that the system to which the prisoners are subjected is excessively harsh. The United States government does not help dispel the suspicions when it refuses to consider them prisoners of war and therefore to apply the Geneva Convention to them. Nor does it seem proper to cite the fact that the base is not on American soil because it is a rented base. Backing from a majority of the public would not serve, either, as justification for the possible excesses and violations of rights. But for the time being, what exist are indications and shadows of suspicion which must materialize or be dispelled through knowledge of the facts from the relevant reports. It is another matter to launch into scandal or anti-Americanism. In any case, the attitude of the American authorities has nothing to do with the one previously and currently displayed by dictatorships and totalitarian systems, including communist ones, which permit neither inspection nor the dissemination of photographs. But this enormous difference is not enough. It must be known as soon as possible whether or not terror has been established in Guantanamo. 
	
	
	


	
For its own reasons, which are linked to its interests and, naturally, to Israel's interests, the United States chose to put intensive pressure on the Palestinian Authority. It wanted the PA to meet difficult, even impossible, security conditions. It also tried, through this pressure, to remove the legitimacy of the PA and its chairman Yasir Arafat under the pretext of terrorism or support for terrorism. This US position, which is fully biased to Israel, strengthened Israeli Prime Minister Ari'el Sharon's attempts to suppress national Palestinian ambitions and achieve his declared objective of establishing Israeli security on the rubble of the legitimate Palestinian rights. 
	
	
 It would have perhaps been logical and acceptable if Washington had demanded a mutual and concurrent cessation of the ongoing violence between the Palestinians and the Israelis and called on Israel not to exploit the calm to open the files of security revenge through assassinations and arrests. It would have been logical and acceptable if Washington had asked Israel to announce its commitment to the principle of withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967 and to end the settlement activity. Such demands constitute the strong base for bringing about calm and stability, putting a final end to violence and terrorism, and turning a new leaf toward fruitful negotiations leading to a just peace acceptable by all sides. 
	
	
 The situation and its tragic repercussions are being viewed only from the Israeli perspective. The killing of hundreds of Palestinians and the increase in the number of martyrs among children are being ignored. And the destruction of homes, installations, and PA infrastructure is being overlooked. This does not serve the interest of peace and the security of the peoples of the region in the long run. On the contrary, it heightens the sense of frustration among all sectors of the Palestinian people and damages the credibility of the United States as a sponsor of the peace process, indeed as an effective partner in the settlement negotiations from the start of the peace process in the late eighties until this process faltered as a result of Israel's intransigence after Sharon came to power. 
	
	
 The United States realizes that the Palestinians are serious in their efforts to achieve a just peace. The Palestinians left no avenue unexplored in their quest for a settlement that enables them to regain their legitimate rights and provides all the peoples of the region, including the Israelis, with security and stability. It is, therefore, unfair to blame the PA for the tension, and sometimes violence, that takes place as a result of the Israeli oppressive measures and activities. Every oppressive or vindictive Israeli action has a Palestinian reaction that cannot be stopped. Before 1994, Israel was in control of all the occupied Palestinian territories and yet it was unable, despite all its forces, weapons, and measures, to achieve full and comprehensive quiet in the West Bank and Gaza throughout 27 years. 
	
	
 In this context, we must note the role of all Arab and international forces in curbing Israeli military operations against Palestinian cities and residential areas and in explaining the true picture of the situation to the United States. Certainly, the intensive efforts that our big sister, Egypt, made to bridle the Israeli oppressive activity and to warn the Israeli prime minister against targeting President Arafat and the PA are highly appreciated by the Palestinian people in particular and the Arab nation in general. 
	
	
	


	
Washington, January 26 (XINHUA) -- US Secretary of State Colin Powell has asked President George W. Bush to reverse the president's decision on al-Qa'ida and Taliban detainees and declare the terrorists as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention, the Washington Times reported on Saturday. 
	
	
 A four-page internal White House memorandum obtained by the Washington Times shows that Powell made the request and that Bush' s National Security Council plans to meet on the matter Monday morning. 
	
	
 Bush decided on January 18 that hundreds of Taliban and members of Usama bin Ladin's al-Qa'ida army are detainees, and not prisoners of war, and thus not subject to rights in the Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 "The secretary of state has requested that you reconsider that decision," White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales wrote in a memo to Bush. "Specifically, he has asked that you conclude that GPW (Geneva Convention II on the Treatment of Prisoners of War) does apply to both al-Qa'ida and the Taliban fighters." 
	
	
 Human rights groups and some European countries have protested Bush's decision, and have been critical of the living conditions for 158 detainees at the US Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
	
	
	


	
Islamabad, March 18, IRNA - Central Leader of Pakistan People Party (PPP) and former provincial minister of North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected US state department report on Human Rights in Iran and other countries, saying America has no right to make such a report as it is itself the violator of human rights. He told IRNA in an interview on Monday, "America has killed thousands of innocent people in almost all parts of the globe particularly in the Muslim world. America, in the guise of its so-called war on terror, has killed and injured thousands of innocent Afghans and the prisoners of war are maltreated." A couple of weeks ago, the US state department in its annual report had revealed that Iran, Pakistan and some other countries are the violators of human rights. "America has a double standard policy. It denounces human rights violation but supports Israel for perishing the Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon," Abbas criticized. He said those countries and nations which are independant in real sense of the world and do not take dictation from the US or accepts its supremacy are labelled as human rights violators. "Those who submit to its policies are showered upon favours," he added. "America always follows its interests. In its so-called war against terrorism and against weapons of mass destruction lies its covert motive and that is its strategic and economic interests," Abbas added. However, he hoped that the people of the world can no more be kept in dark. "They can see and observe the unjust and discriminatory policies of America. People do not believe whatever the America says," he concluded.	


	
France's Chirac says Argentina must make necessary choices 
	
	
 Text of report by French news agency AFP 
	
	
 Paris, 2 January: During a telephone conversation on Wednesday [2 January] with the director general of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Horst Koehler, President Jacques Chirac stressed the need for Argentina to be able to "make the choices" imposed on it by the crisis it is going through. Reporting on the conversation, Elysee [presidency] spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that the head of state had "expressed the hope that the Argentine authorities will know how to make the choices needed for their country's future". "France, like its partners, is in contact with international financial institutions," the president said, "and is ready to support the action of the IMF with a view to attaining a solution to this crisis." Jacques Chirac, Mrs Colonna said, also raised with the IMF director general "the situation of a number of other countries, among them Lebanon in connection with the consolidation of economic reforms in this country, with which France has special ties"!

Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens has admitted that it is unfeasible to guarantee the flow of revenues to the government if the Finance Secretariat maintains its estimate that the crude export platform in 2002 will average 1.825 million barrels per day, at a price of $17.00 per barrel. 
	
	
 "One would have to talk in depth with the Finance Secretariat's people to hear the criteria that they used to establish that benchmark," he claimed, declining to give details on the manner in which the federal government's secretariats establish the price of crude in the General Criteria for Economic Policy. 
	
	
 In fact, Martens admitted that this volume of crude exports has not been achieved this year. According to Pemex [Mexican Petroleum] figures, between January and September the daily exports of barrels of oil did not exceed an average of 1.71 million. During September alone, this average dropped to 1.64 million. 
	
	
 In the General Preliminary Criteria for Economic Policy 2002, the final text of which is being presented to Congress by the government today, the Finance Secretariat estimated an average price of $17.00 per barrel for the crude mixture, and predicted that the export platform would be 1.825 million barrels per day. 
	
	
 The volume appears large in the current economic context, when oil prices have fallen back to 1999 levels. Hence, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), will decide at its meeting on Wednesday whether or not to cut its worldwide crude production in an effort to shore up energy prices. 
	
	
 Traditionally, Mexico has supported the OPEC cutbacks; however, analysts agreed that it will now tend to support the United States, the main world consumer, and the one that would be adversely affected by a possible increase in crude prices. 
	
	
 George Baker, director of Mexico Energy Intelligence, expressed this opinion: "In the event that the Mexican Government gives priority to its relationship with the United States, it will not be a game without risks. And it is possible that, at some given time, OPEC may hand it the bill for not collaborating in the reduction of the oil supply." 
	
	
 He noted that the Mexican economy is very closely linked to that of the United States, and hence no oil producer, whether a member of OPEC or not, is in such a disadvantageous situation. 
	
	
 Frederic Lasserre, an energy sector analyst for the firm Societe Generale, held the view that Mexico's close relationship with the United States prevents it from becoming more committed to OPEC. 
	
	
 "The US authorities would not like to have it (Mexico) as a trading partner and, at the same time, close to OPEC," he observed. 
	
	
 With regard to prices, he gave a reminder that the reason that prompted Mexico to collaborate with OPEC in 1998 was, in fact, the decline in them. 
	
	
 But Ken Miller, from the firm Purvin &amp;amp; Gertz, included an additional factor. 
	
	
 "Mexico sought out the leading producers: Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, not only for the prices, but also because of the competition on the crude oil market (in US territory)," he claimed, pointing out that prices have not yet fallen as low as they did then. 
	
	
 In 1998, the Mexican oil mixture averaged $10.17 per barrel: now, the lowest levels have reached $14.00 per barrel. 
	
	
 Miller remarked that the worldwide economic slowdown has shrunk the demand for energy sources, which could lead the independent producers, including Mexico, to operate in coordination with the oil cartel. 
	
	
 Nevertheless, according to the researcher from the UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico] Economics Department, Angel de la Vega, since the Fox administration does not have the security of a fiscal reform available, it cannot be ruled out that Mexico might collaborate with OPEC in the event of a more serious reduction in oil prices. 
	
	
 Miguel Garcia Reyes, a specialist in petroleum geopolitics at the College of Mexico, claimed that Mexico's distancing from OPEC has become more intensified since the attacks on the United States. 
	
	
 He emphasized: "Now Mexico is positioned between two fronts: it recognizes the need for reducing the supply on the market, but the policy is to support the United States and supply it with more crude if it should become necessary." 
	
	
 In terms of market, the Mexican exports do not play an important role, but the support for OPEC on the part of Mexico, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia in 1998 and 1999 lent credibility to the policy of cutbacks, and achieved the recovery of prices. 
	
	
 Promises Are Cheap 
	
	
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has agreed on three cuts in its production thus far this year, for the purpose of preventing the crude prices from becoming weaker. Nevertheless, it has not kept its promises.

THE ABDUCTION of a French diplomat's wife on Thursday has introduced a political dimension to the kidnap-for-ransom pestilence that has spread dramatically during the past 10 months. 
	
	
 The kidnap gang freed her and her driver within two hours of seizure. No ransom was paid. 
	
	
 The abduction, however, delivered a more devastating blow on the capacity of the Macapagal administration to crack down on kidnap syndicates than the grim statistics trotted out by Teresita Ang-See, the Chinese-Filipino anti-crime "crusader," who has relished the role of Cassandra to the Philippine National Police under the new administration. 
	
	
 Since 1992 when organized crime became a leading preoccupation in the national agenda, the main victims of the predatory syndicates have been Ang-See's compatriots in the Chinese-Filipino community. 
	
	
 The conventional explanation is that because of their wealth, they are the logical prey from which to extract ransom money--a perverse form of nationalist racism and redistribution of national wealth. 
	
	
 The Abu Sayyaf kidnapping of foreigners in Sipadan, Malaysia, and in Dos Palmas, Palawan, broke this ethnicity pattern. 
	
	
 But the seizure of the diplomat's wife and her driver was the first time in 10 years that the gangs struck at members of the diplomatic community, whose immunity has been somehow respected by organized syndicates. 
	
	
 The seizure sent alarm bells ringing in the diplomatic community in this country. The repercussions in the home governments and countries are as damaging as the prolonged hostage-taking by the Abu Sayyaf of French, German, Malaysian, Lebanese and Finnish nationals during the Estrada administration. 
	
	
 Then President Joseph Estrada had to cancel visits to Paris and other European capitals in 2000 after he was told that he would receive a hostile reception from the European public over the lengthy impasse of negotiations for the hostages' release. 
	
	
 From my own sources in the diplomatic community, as well as in the Philippine National Police, the diplomat's wife and her driver went to the French school in Bicutan at around 10 a.m., in response to a call from school authorities who reported that her son had some accident. 
	
	
 On the way, a group of about six armed men in uniforms blocked her brand-new car (which had no diplomatic plate) at Better Living Subdivision, Paranaque, and boarded it. 
	
	
 The gang drove the car around the vicinity while they interrogated the victims for about two hours. The hijackers asked them for money--one million pesos was mentioned--which she had supposedly withdrawn from the bank. She told them she had not withdrawn such money and that she was the wife of a senior French diplomat. The gunmen let her go. 
	
	
 The PNP, which believes it was a case of mistaken identity, could not explain why it took the gang two hours to know the identity of the lady. 
	
	
 After detaining them for about two hours, they drove her and the driver to a squatters' area and dropped them off near the Bicutan exit, but not before they took her necklace and wallet. 
	
	
 They did not take her ring and other pieces of jewelry. The gang fled with the car, and the victims took a tricycle home. The details of the crime and the swift release are less important than the political implications. Whether the incident was plain holdup, as the PNP would like to see it, the abduction reinforced the growing perception in the diplomatic community and foreign governments that there is a breakdown in law and order and that the Macapagal administration is not in control. 
	
	
 This perception is also fueled by the crime statistics of Ang-See, who represents the pessimistic outlook in contrast to the more dismissive outlook of the PNP whose statistics are less alarming than those of Ang-See. 
	
	
 While Ang-See's statistics, derived mainly from non-official sources, paint a grim picture, they should not be ignored. 
	
	
 At the same time, the PNP can't be burying its head in the sand and offering explanations all the time, rather than check the rise of kidnappings. 
	
	
 Ang-See's close collaboration with former PNP chief, now Sen. Panfilo Lacson, is an open secret. Some administration officials wonder whether she paints doomsday scenarios just to embarrass the administration and to portray the contrast in performance between the PNP under Lacson and the current PNP leadership, which has no love lost with Lacson. 
	
	
 Since the members of the diplomatic community had previously been immune from the predatory attacks of the gang, the abduction of the diplomat's wife naturally has generated anxieties among foreign governments about how safe their diplomats are in this country. 
	
	
 There is a strong perception in the diplomatic community that the abduction was a fake kidnap-for- ransom and was a political act to demonstrate the administration's incapacity to put crime under control. 
	
	
 The reasoning behind this perception is that if the gangs were after ransom money, it did not matter whether their victims belonged to the diplomatic community. 
	
	
 The perception is that there was a political message in the abductions staged by some groups that are determined to make this government fail. 
	
	
 A number of embassies here, including the American, French, German and Japanese, have issued advisories to their nationals warning them of risks when travelling in some parts of the country. 
	
	
 The advisories have been prompted by domestic lawlessness and political turbulence rather than by a possible outbreak of insidious terrorist attacks associated with al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden and provoked by the American military action in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 At the rate syndicates are abducting targets--regardless of their ethnic identity and their diplomatic status--with impunity, the administration faces a more serious and direct challenge to its capacity to govern from the specter of lawlessness than from the daunting problem of sparking an economic recovery amid the global economic downturn. 
	
	
 We don't need al-Qaida terrorist attacks in this country to bring the government down in turmoil, create uncertainties in the business community, and frighten tourists and investors away. 
	
	
 The diplomatic community's perception of President Macapagal is that she is organized, knows her economics, does her homework, and has been unscathed by scandals that have been rubbed on her skin by a scandal-mongering opposition. 
	
	
 But the downside is that the deterioration of peace and order is her nemesis that is undoing all her diplomatic initiatives in the world stage to project the Philippines as a staunch ally in the US-led coalition in the war on international terrorism. 
	
	
 Some diplomats raise questions about her priorities. They think she is travelling too much, while internal problems sap the country's energy, and that she has misplaced strategic priorities in her overseas visits. 
	
	
 The fire is raging at home, these sources say, not in the United States, China, Japan or Afghanistan. Her hoses have to be directed at internal terrorism. She has more dangerous enemies at home than elsewhere.	


	
Spanish daily blasts "meaningless" US announcement on Guantanamo detainees 
	
	
 Text of unsigned editorial headlined "The USA tramples on the rights of all the Guantanamo prisoners" published by Spanish newspaper El Mundo web site on 9|February 
	
	
 The White House spokesman announced the night before last that the Taleban prisoners being held in Guantanamo will enjoy the treatment envisaged under the Geneva Convention, but not the foreign prisoners from Al-Qai'dah, who the Bush administration considers terrorists. The Geneva Convention is the international treaty signed in 1949 by the USA and other countries, which regulates the treatment of prisoners of war and grants them a set of legal and humanitarian rights. Bush's spokesman added that none of the 158 detainees in Guantanamo is going to be given prisoner-of-war status, which makes the apparently positive part of the White House statement meaningless. The USA refuses to admit that these detainees are prisoners of war because, under the Convention, they would have the right not to answer any questions except to give their name and rank, they could not be tried except for war crimes and they would have to be repatriated after the war ends. So when the White House says it is going to treat the Taleban in accordance with the Geneva Convention, it is pure rhetoric, nothing other than a public relations exercise and will be meaningless in practice. The key issue is not so much whether they are treated humanely and their beliefs respected, but their legal status. If they don't enjoy the advantages of being prisoners of war and do not have the right to be tried under US criminal law, what jurisdiction will be used for these men being held incommunicado in a place that isn't the USA or Cuba? Nobody in the US government has answered this question, even though international organizations like the Red Cross and Human Rights Watch have denounced the defenceless situation of these prisoners, who have no access to lawyers and do not enjoy the minimum guarantees for judicial proceedings which, in their case, do not exist. Donald Rumsfeld and other senior Washington officials have tried to justify what is happening in Guantanamo on the grounds that the detainees are dangerous terrorists. That may be the case, but even the worst criminals have the right to a lawyer and to know the charges against them. It can only be paradoxical that a supposedly model democracy like the USA can trample on the law to such an extent. 
	
	
	


	
Norway should be in the forefront of combating climate problems. The government wants to play an active role internationally but we should also work on reducing emissions here at home. 
	
	
 "The government wants to point to a significant reduction of climate gate emissions before 2005 after Norway has ratified the Kyoto Protocol in the course of the year," Environmental Protection Minister Borge Brende has written. Between now and 2008, the government's environmental initiative will be given concrete form in a report to the Storting this spring, in which an early quota system will occupy a central place. 
	
	
 Norway and the other rich countries have a moral responsibility to achieve real reductions. Regardless of what Norway and other countries manage to do in this respect, we must prepare ourselves for climate changes. According to the United Nations' climate panel, in the next 10 to 20 years changes in the climate will be almost unaffected by what we do in the way of initiatives in the next few years to reduce emissions of climate gases. The explanation is that the increased concentration of climate gases in the atmosphere and the slowness of the climate system will make a certain degree of global warming unavoidable. 
	
	
 In recent years the RegClim research project, under the aegis of the Norwegian Research Council, has worked to estimate the way the climate will develop in Norway in 30 to 50 years. The main conclusions were that the trend toward warmer weather and more precipitation will presumably continue. 
	
	
 The climate changes will be different from region to region. The western part of Norway will experience the markedly greatest increase in precipition in the fall. North Norway will also get more precipitation in the fall but warmer temperatures in the winter. In the eastern part of Norway the biggest increase in precipitation will be in the winter. In coming years the winters will be less snowy but greener and wetter. 
	
	
 These extrapolations of the state of the climate are not completely reliable. Even if we can say with great certainty that climate changes will come, we need more knowledge about the effects . 
	
	
 How must local societies organize themselves if a couple of hurricanes every year become normal? How should we prepare ourselves for more and bigger floods? What consequences will the increase in temperature have for raising livestock and fish? Will climate changes produce new types of pests that will create problems? For the next few years our goal is to both gain more knowledge and put together good preparedness strategies. 
	
	
 All the world's countries and peoples are affected by climate changes but it is the poor countries that are being hit the hardest. Even if developing countries have contributed to these climate problems to just a slight degree, they will nevertheless bear the greatest burden. 
	
	
 Norway and other industrialized countries, on the other hand, have fairly good prospects of grappling with climate changes because we have an economy to put necessary measures to work. We must avoid seeing environmental problems increase the social differences in the world. For that reason the rich countries-those making the climate worse-must go on the offensive to solve the problems we ourselves have created. 
	
	
 In the Sem statement the coalition government warned of a more offensive climate policy. An offensive climate police will bring costs with it. But if we do not make these expenditures now, the bill for the generations to come will be even bigger. This our conscience ought not to permit us. 
	
	
 The challenge will be to introduce the most cost-effective climate policy possible and at the same time take Norwegian business and industry's competitiveness into consideration. 
	
	
 The elements in a more offensive climate policy are: 
	
	
 Initiatives between now and 2008: The government wants to show demonstrable progress in the reduction of climate emissions by 2005. We are setting the stage for Norway to get national initiatives under way earlier than we are required to under the Kyoto Protocol. The government's policy statement states, among other things, that the establishment of a national quota system should be speeded up. 
	
	
 Implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The government wants to set the stage for Norway to ratify the Kyoto Protocol next year. There is consensus that a broad quota system with international quota exchange should be used to achieve our emission responsibilities during the first obligatory period, 2008-2012. 
	
	
 Pursue the international climate negotiations. The consensus that has been achieved internationally about the period 2008-2012 is just the first step down the road. For later periods, sharper reductions are necessary and there is also the need to get more countries to take on climate obligations. Norway still wants to play an active role in this process. 
	
	
 The report to the Storting that the government is preparing for the spring will further specify which measures will be implemented between now and 2008. A proposal for an early quota system will be at the center of this report. There exists the potential for significant reductions in climate gas emissions in Norway that will not produced with today's resources. The use of quotas will be a cost-effective means of achieving better results. 
	
	
 A quota is a right to emit a certain quantity of climate gases during a certain period and this right can be sold on a market. The advantages are that the authorities can set a ceiling on all emissions. Businesses that are obligated by a quota can then choose whether they want to buy those quotas they need or introduce measures to reduce emissions. 
	
	
 Many countries, among them Denmark, Great Britain, and Sweden, are already under way developing early quota systems. In addition to being effective, an early quota system would also give business and industry useful experience before the international quota system following the Kyoto Protocol comes into effect in 2008. 
	
	
 In the government's work to put the quota system into shape in Norway, we are now discussing a number of problems. Some of these are: 
	
	
 The range-which gases and sectors should be included in the quota system, and how businesses exposed to competition should be dealt with. 
	
	
 Measures about emissions-how much all of those obligated by a quota can emit. 
	
	
 Fines for exceeding the quota limit. 
	
	
 The possibility of cooperating with other countries' early quota systems. 
	
	
 I am pleased that there now seems to be broad political consensus that in Norway as well we should get under way with an early quota system. 
	
	
 Regardless of the shape of the measures in Norway, Norwegian businesses as well ought to contribute to reducing emissions in poor countries. The green development mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol opens the way for businesses from industrialized countries to pay for the introduction of more environmentally-friendly technology in polluting industries in developing countries. This mechanism can already be used-and before 2008, too. In addition to producing climate benefits, such measures will contribute to development and reduced local pollution in poor countries. 
	
	
 Norway is one of the countries in this world that has earned the most from fossil fuels. This gives us a special responsibility in climate policy-not least vis-a-vis the poorest countries. 
	
	
	


	
President Bush's projection of Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' and his threat of military action against them has evoked world-wide criticism. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said after meeting US Vice President Dick Cheney in Washington that there is no evidence of weapons' proliferation against these nations to substantiate the US charge. French officials said that the rhetoric of good and evil is not suitable for the realities of today's world. Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that Bush has made a 'big mistake' by lumping the three nations together as they are different from each other. NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson said in New York that credible evidence will be prerequisite for NATO's support for any military action against the three nations. 
	
	
 The lumping of Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' by President Bush has certainly not raised US image. It has rather tarnished it, since the international community expects a mature, compassionate and civilised conduct from the United States as the only superpower in the world. It should have been on the side of the smaller and weaker nations, rather than targeting them one by one in the pursuit of its global agenda. It should have worked to eliminate injustice, instead of trying to harass other countries for national prejudices. The world expects a civilised conduct from the United States in place of arrogance, discrimination and injustice. Washington is, in fact, treading a path of coercion, intimidation and blackmailing against the smaller and weaker nations. President Bush is intolerant to the dissent to his policy of domination in total negation of the lofty principles of morality, ethic and democracy, which he assertively holds so dear to his heart. If terrorism is to be fought successfully, the United States should better withdraw its support to the forces of injustice, tyranny and oppression in the world. Fight against poverty alone will not be a productive effort to fight terrorism. It's injustice that breeds hatred and revolt. Let Middle East be the test ground for US sincerity to fight terrorism. Its unfettered support to Israel is based on injustice and this distortion in its policies needs to be removed to ensure its own security as well as that of its allies. 
	
	
	


	
Following the presidential vote in Zimbabwe, there is just one thing Robert Mugabe cannot be reproached for, and that is having made a secret of his determination to stay in power by every possible means. The electoral hijacking had been announced, prepared, and organized. It has now taken place. Should one be surprised? Since he nearly lost his parliamentary majority in June 2000, the head of state has stated and restated to his supporters that the presidential election was going to be a "war." He was as good as his word. 
	
	
 The "war for land" continued, at the risk of causing famine. The army swore allegiance to the "father of independence," regardless of the verdict at the ballot box. The independence of Zimbabwe's justice system was compromised. The local press was harassed. The opposition MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) was the victim of "state terrorism" that its candidate Morgan Tsvangirai rightly condemned after being beaten in an election loaded against him from start to finish, from drawing up the electoral lists to counting the votes. The real secret of the ballot box will never be revealed. 
	
	
 This "fait accompli" in Zimbabwe is a challenge for the international community. It can only rise to meet it by making some radical changes. Indignant protests apart, nothing was done to prevent the disaster awaiting one of the key countries in southern Africa, seen as the continent's growth pole. The weapon of so-called "intelligent" sanctions proved ineffective, especially as the punitive measures were taken too late and only served to deny Robert Mugabe and his associates trips abroad and access to the funds they have spirited away. They amounted to no more than a ban on holidays and a golden retirement. Finally and most importantly, Great Britain remained locked in the familiar psychodrama between the former colonizer and colonized. Africa, with its own "observers," has just ratified a shameful electoral sham. Kenya and Tanzania even "congratulated" Robert Mugabe on his re-election after the first round. 
	
	
 It is time to speak the language of truth. Either the absence of democracy in Africa is no longer any more of a problem for Europe than the lack of development, or it is time to get serious about "good governance" as a condition for aid. Either the New Partnership for African Development (Nepad) is merely to entertain the international gallery during the occasional conference on "sustainable development" or Africa must itself impose a minimum of probity and respect for fundamental liberties. It has the means. Robert Mugabe remains in power thanks to the maize, oil, and electricity he supplies to South Africa. In Zimbabwe it is better to have an end to the torment than torment without end. 
	
	
 Fortunately, Europe is no longer "Africa's policeman." But it must demand that the countries of Africa put their own house in order. 
	
	
 
	
	
	


	
Taipei, Jan. 3 (CNA) -- Premier Chang Chun-hsiung expressed alarm Thursday at reports that a legislator was kidnapped and held for three days in a Taipei hotel, saying that his government will do its utmost to stop gangsters from preying on lawmakers. 
	
	
 Presiding over an inter-agency conference on social order, Chang asked the police to catch the gangsters who allegedly detained Legislator Huang Hsien-chou at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Taipei. 
	
	
 Later that day, a man was arrested in Taipei in relation to the case. Chang Fu-shun, 27, is said to be the younger brother of Chang Hui-hua, who allegedly invited Huang to meet her at the hotel and who Huang claimed was in the hotel room when he was detained. 
	
	
 Huang claimed the previous day in Taichung that he had been trapped by the gangsters, who had pretended to be his political supporters. 
	
	
 Huang told reporters that the gangsters, who included at least two men and a woman, made an appointment to meet him at the hotel Dec. 26. When he arrived, he claimed, one of them offered him a drink and he lost consciousness after drinking it. 
	
	
 When he awoke, he found that his hands and feet had been bound. The gangsters demanded NT$2 million from him but finally settled for NT$800,000 which they withdrew using Huang's credit card. 
	
	
 Huang was released Dec. 31 and reported to police that day. 
	
	
 Huang revealed what he claimed to be the whole story at a news conference Wednesday night after press reports said he had in fact been caught with prostitutes in the hotel and blackmailed. 
	
	
 The police said that the hotel room had been paid for by a woman who checked in under the name of Lin An, which they said was an alias used by Chang Hui-hua. 
	
	
	


	
The great leader [yongdoja] Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: 
	
	
 "Although the imperialists and reactionaries speak ill of socialism and pretend to be the 'advocates of human rights,' they are the ones who really abuse human rights." 
	
	
 At a recent United Nations meeting, the United States picked a quarrel with us by speaking as if our country had a "human rights problem." This was not the first time the United States acted this way. More often than not, the United States, acting as if it were an "adjudicator of human rights," published the so-called "Annual Human Rights Report" and "Annual Report on International Religious Freedom," attempting to teach a lesson or two to countries -- including our country -- it deems disagreeable. 
	
	
 The United States, however, is not qualified to speak of "human rights" in other countries. One can easily talk in a similar manner of the racial discrimination in the United States which is becoming more serious with the passage of time. Many people in the United States have their human rights ruthlessly trampled upon simply because they are colored. 
	
	
 According to a poll conducted jointly by the US daily "The Washington Post" and Harvard University, people are wondering whether the American society is not reverting to the 1960s when racial discrimination was very serious. A total of 1,709 people, including blacks, Latinos, and Asians, participated in the poll. They responded that three out of ten blacks could not find job or have been denied responsible positions in the workplace simply because they were blacks and eight out of ten blacks and two thirds of the Latinos and Asians said they had suffered persecution and had been subjected to abusive language. 
	
	
 Ali Barr [name as published], a black man working at a TV station in Atlanta, has recently experienced racial discrimination in a restaurant. When Ali Barr and his company entered the restaurant, ten white people inside the restaurant appeared surprised to see them and a waitress told them to leave the premise immediately. Recalling the scene, Ali Barr said: "Myself and my company were racially discriminated against. I can never forget what I saw that day as long as I live." 
	
	
 As a result of racial discrimination, many among the ethnic minorities reportedly have been driven out of urban areas. According to 2000 vital statistics released not so long ago in the United States, one out of four residents of the suburban areas was an ethnic minority. This figure is said to be 5 percent higher than it was a decade ago. 
	
	
 People will likely remember the fact that the United States withdrew its delegation from the UN conference against racism held last September in Durban, South Africa. In the beginning, the United States refused to send a delegation, but eventually dispatched a low-level delegation. When voices critical of the Israelis' violation of the Palestinian people's human rights were raised at the conference, the United States went so far as to withdraw its delegation. 
	
	
 Since this is how a government claiming to represent its people behaves in international settings, it is no wonder people at home follow the government's example. 
	
	
 Instead of talking about "human rights issues" of other countries, the United States should find out how things are in its own house where the abuse of human rights is rampant and make effort to rectify the practices. 
	
	
	


	
The attacks on the World Trade Center Towers and the Pentagon were attacks on the freedoms and values for which the United States and the Western world stand, President Bush declared shortly afterward, and many people in Europe repeated it after him. 
	
	
 There is a great deal of truth in that, but in the light of what has happened afterwards, the question arises as to whether the Americans and their allies themselves are not sometimes inclined to sacrifice these values for the "good cause." There is no doubt that a military operation and intensified security measures were imperative after the terrible tragedy of 11 September. That al-Qa'ida terrorists and Taliban fighters are not very concerned about the human suffering that they have caused is also generally known. However, the ends -- dealing with those opponents -- does not justify all the means. 
	
	
 There is, in the first place, the case of the military action in Afghanistan. Apart from the reasons or justification for such an action, all the combatants' war conduct must be constantly tested against the standards of international humanitarian law; that is, the rules which curb the use of force during a military operation. Back in 1949, it was agreed by nearly all the states in the world that the sufferings of war must henceforth become more bearable, especially for those who are not directly involved in the conflict. These rules, laid down in the four Geneva Conventions, provide, among other things, for the protection of sick and wounded servicemen and prisoners of war. In addition, attempts must be made to prevent any unnecessary suffering by both military personnel and civilians by, for instance, imposing restrictions on the use of weapons. 
	
	
 But the greatest attention is paid to the fate of the civilian population: In principle, the latter can never be the object of a military operation. Hence, humanitarian law requires that in all circumstances a distinction be made between military targets and those not involved in the armed conflict. The two supplementary protocols to the Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1977, increase, among other things, the protection of the civilian population. Many countries are parties to them, but the United States has not ratified these protocols, so that the additional protection they offer is difficult to enforce in a conflict in which US troops are taking part. 
	
	
 Although it is doubtful that all the news reaches us from Afghanistan, a great many press reports suggest that humanitarian law was violated regularly over the past few weeks. This has happened despite solemn pledges to the United Nations that the United States "is committed to minimizing civilian casualties and damage to civilian property." 
	
	
 Hence you can hardly speak of a "targeting error" when a Red Cross warehouse, although clearly recognizable by the large red cross painted on the roof, was shelled twice by US aircraft. Such a building enjoys the highest possible protection, and can and should never be the object of an attack, unless it is clearly established that it is being used for military purposes. 
	
	
 In other case, too, it seems doubtful that the crucial distinction between military and civilian targets was made systematically. Newspaper headlines such as "United Nations Confirms US Bombing of Village and Mosque" and "100 Killed in Bombing in Eastern Afghanistan" speak for themselves. According to witnesses, these were attacks in an area where neither al-Qa'ida troops nor Taliban had been observed. Even if these attacks were directed against a clear military target, the large number of civilian casualties would still never be justifiable, because whoever plans a military attack must take all precautions to prevent such a tragedy. 
	
	
 Not only with the protection of the civilian population does something sometimes go wrong. Secretary Rumsfeld's statements (on 20 November 2001) that "the United States is not inclined to negotiate surrenders, nor are we in a position, with relatively small numbers of forces on the ground, to accept prisoners," and that "my hope is that they will be either killed or taken prisoner (by the Northern Alliance)" also suggested that death would be the only way out of the conflict for the Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters. That would amount to a flagrant violation of humanitarian law: whoever ceases fighting for whatever reason is entitled to protection. It is all the more to be deplored that such statements come from somebody who, as a senior commander, serves as an example to others regarding the observance of rules of humanitarian law. 
	
	
 Now, nearly two months later, concern about the fate of the captive Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters has further increased. Moving the captives to the Guantanamo Bay military base on Cuba is rightly whipping up a storm of protest. Humanitarian law leaves no doubt that those who fall captive in their opponent's hands are entitled at all times to decent treatment, even if they do not qualify for prisoner of war status. Transporting these people, shackled hand and foot and with hoods over their heads, shaving their beards -- which form part of their religious identity -- and their "accommodation" in half-open and cages that are much too small can probably never pass this test... 
	
	
 The consequences of 11 September are also making themselves felt far from the battlefield. Shortly after its decision to take military action, the Bush administration also decided to provide the press with only sparse information about the course of the operation. Because press freedom -- the jewel of the US Constitution -- can be restricted for reasons of national security. The right of citizens to such information about their government's actions is crippled by the fact that it is being accepted for the present without much complaint. 
	
	
 Under the protest of international and US human rights organizations but with the approval of large sections of the population, antiterrorism measures are being adopted in great haste. Foreigners suspected of maintaining (loose) ties with terrorist organizations can be detained indefinitely. There is uncertainty about the precise number, but it is certain that over 1,000 men from the Middle East have already been arrested. 
	
	
 In the media, the possibility of questioning presumed terrorists very roughly is also being considered aloud. The need for timely and accurate information about possible new attacks is naturally particularly great, but whether the global ban on torture can be abused on that account is another matter. 
	
	
 What raises even more questions is the order that President Bush issued last November. Through that, the United States can detain and try anybody who is not a US citizen and who is suspected of being a member of al-Qa'ida or of being involved in international terrorism in one way or another. Only special military commissions can try them. It is stated in black and white that it is hardly feasible for these commissions to apply the normal principles of law and rules of evidence. Consequently, evidence will be accepted that "a normal person" deems to have the value of evidence. Hence guilt need not be established "beyond reasonable doubt," nor is there any mention of a presumption of innocence. Appeal is not possible, but the death penalty is. On the other hand, US Taliban or al-Qa'ida fighters, such as the recently captured John Walker Lindh, will be tried by ordinary US criminal courts. 
	
	
 There also seems to be a difference among the foreigners: In all likelihood, captured British fighters will be sent to Britain after questioning. Presumed war criminals such as Milosevic enjoy all the guarantees of a fair trial, but the Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters at Guantanamo will get a trial which falls far short of the basic standards of the US Constitution and the treaty on civil and political rights ratified by the United States. 
	
	
 Not in the United States alone are the screws being tightened. A number of other countries have sharpened their laws following 11 September, from increased detention possibilities to stricter legislation on asylum and immigration. In December 2001, the UK proclaimed a state of emergency and passed the Antiterrorism, Crime, and Security Act. Whenever there is a suspicion that a foreigner is involved in international terrorism, he will be arrested and imprisoned. If it emerges that the person concerned cannot be removed from British territory because he is in serious danger in his own country, he can be detained almost indefinitely under this law. 
	
	
 Other states have used the US tragedy to polish their own image. Out of well-understood self-interest, countries such as Russia, China, and Israel joined in the Bush administration's anti-terrorism campaign, because it enabled them to compare their domestic situation with the US situation and ask for moral support for the fight they have been waging against terrorism for years. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called Palestinian leader Arafat "Our Usama Bin Ladin." 
	
	
 The fight against terrorism is undoubtedly justified, but, as with every struggle, it also holds true that the fundamental principles of human rights and humanitarian law must be respected. Observance of these rules will not insure that the fight against terrorism is lost; it will prove respect for human dignity, of which the West is rightly a champion. 
	
	
	


	
AMMAN -- After months of low-profile activities, the 14 professional associations held their first anti-normalisation conference on Sunday during which they renewed calls for severing all ties with "the Zionist enemy." 
	
	
 More than 50 participants, most of them members of the unions' Anti-Normalisation Committee, took part in the one-day conference, held against a backdrop of uncertainty as to the future of the 10-year-old peace process. 
	
	
 The speakers outlined the plight of the Palestinians under occupation and the suffering of Iraqi people facing crippling international sanctions for the eleventh consecutive year. 
	
	
 They also lambasted "US-British aggression on Iraq and meddling in its internal affairs." 
	
	
 "Normalisation with the Zionist enemy is a crime against the country, nation and humanity," read one of the banners hoisted at the Professional Associations Complex. 
	
	
 According to Council of Unions' president Mohammad Oran, the anti- normalisation drive remains an Arab, Muslim and human goal. It is also a binding decision taken by the professional associations' general assembly, after Jordan sealed a peace treaty with Israel in October 1994. 
	
	
 Former Hamas spokesperson Ibrahim Ghosheh and spokesperson for the Muslim Brotherhood Jamil Abu Baker took part in the conference. 
	
	
 Sunday's gathering is the first such public event since authorities cracked down early last year on the anti-normalisation committee after they made public a blacklist of Jordanians they claimed had established "ties with the Jewish state." 
	
	
 During Sunday's conference, nine papers were discussed. 
	
	
 Political affiliation among association members lean heavily towards Islamist, pan-Arab and leftist groups. 
	
	
 Conference participants warned against Israeli "expansionist plans" and argued that the peace treaty was in favour of the "Zionist enemy." 
	
	
 They called for "ostracising" those who deal with Israeli partners and maintaining a total boycott of the Jewish state at the grassroots level. 
	
	
 On the official level, relations between Jordan and Israel have been strained since the outbreak of the Intifada 16 months ago. Jordan has delayed sending its ambassador designate, Abdul Ilah Kurdi, to Tel Aviv. 
	
	
 The conference also honoured the families of Jordanian detainees in Israeli jails. 
	
	
	


	
LONDON, Jan 24 (AFP) -- British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Thursday [24 January] it was "far preferable" that British prisoners held at the US Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba should face justice in Britain. 
	
	
 Three Britons are among 158 captured al-Qa'ida and Taliban fighters detained at the camp. They were captured in Afghanistan during the US-led military campaign against the country's now-crumbled hardline Taliban regime. 
	
	
 "It is far preferable if they are British citizens for them to come to the United Kingdom and face justice here," Straw told BBC radio. 
	
	
 He was speaking after American John Walker Lindh, captured while fighting for the Taliban, arrived handcuffed and shackled at Dulles International Airport outside the US capital late Wednesday and was taken to a nearby jail. 
	
	
 He faces trial in his own country on charges of conspiring to kill US nationals and supporting terrorist groups. 
	
	
 The US military put on hold transfers of prisoners to the Cuba base Wednesday. 
	
	
 International criticism of conditions at the makeshift camp have grown since the first detainees were transferred from Afghanistan earlier this month. 
	
	
 The prisoners are being held at the temporary outdoor detention facility called "Camp X-Ray" where each has a separate cell with a concrete floor, wooden roof and chain-link walls.	


	
(CORR)Spanish premier, EU leader urge Russia to ratify Kyoto Protocol 
	
	
 (Correcting "handed over" in line 2 to read "sent". Corrected version follows.) 
	
	
 Text of report by Spanish news agency Efe 
	
	
 Barcelona, 14 March: The current president of the EU, Jose Maria Aznar, and the president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, have sent a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they urge him to promote the ratification by Russia of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. In the letter, to which Efe has had access, Aznar and Prodi explain that on 4 March the council of EU environment ministers agreed the adoption of a decision for approval of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change on behalf of the European Community. They explain that this agreement is an important step for the EU in fulfilling the political pledge to achieve ratification of the Protocol before the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development. To this end, Aznar and Prodi report that only the internal ratification processes in each of the member states have now to be concluded and they emphasize that these are at an advanced stage and in some cases have been completed. "Therefore, we have complete confidence that the instruments of ratification of the European Community and of the 15 member states will be able to be lodged with the Secretariat of the United Nations within the time scale anticipated, in other words, in early June of this year," they add. However, the letter emphasizes that for the Kyoto Protocol to be able to enter into force in the near future it is not enough for EU ratification to be guaranteed and they thus urge Putin to ensure that Russia also moves ahead with ratification. They make this request "convinced of the Russian Federation's resolute commitment to the Kyoto Protocol" and believing that in this manner the EU and Russia would continue to show the "leadership" which they believe they have shared "with such fruitful results, in international cooperation in the fight against climate change".

Australia's plans to construct a space port on Christmas Island, located just a stone's throw, a mere 500 kilometres south of Jakarta, has concerned some in the Indonesian Government. Although diplomatic overtures to express official objections have not yet been made, the government through the National Space and Flight Agency has already warned of the possible risks facing Indonesia. The nation should certainly be concerned about the plans to build a rocket launch pad, work on the infrastructure for which is due to start in 2002, with launches beginning from 2004. The problem is, this large-scale project right in our own backyard could not only potentially cause space debris consisting of bits of rocket, fuel and satellites to fall into Indonesian territory, but will also disrupt flights and shipping. 
	
	
 If a rocket launch fails, debris weighing hundreds of tonnes will be scattered over the densely-populated island of Java or the tourist island of Bali, and on to the east as far as Timor. 
	
	
 The memory Russia's Mir space station which after 15 years fell to earth on 23 March 2001 is still fresh of. Fortunately shrapnel from the former space station, which measured 33 x 30 x 27 metres and weighed 137 tonnes, burned up as it re-entered the earth's atmosphere somewhere over the Pacific Ocean between Chile and Australia. Nevertheless, intact pieces of debris weighing up to 20 to 30 tonnes fell into the Pacific Ocean. 
	
	
 Prior to that, two Soviet satellites struck the earth. Cosmos 1402 in January 1978 fell over the Northern Hemisphere and Cosmos 954, which contained radioactive substances, crashed above the uninhabited tundra of Canada in September 1977. 
	
	
 Even more worrying is the possibility that a space station could be transformed into a military base and pose a threat to Indonesia's national sovereignty. At such close proximity, if bilateral relations with Australia were to take a turn for the worse, firing at Indonesia would be extremely easy. 
	
	
 On the other hand, Christmas Island is certainly an ideal location for rocket launches due to its proximity to the Equator and the geostationary orbit (GSO). [passage omitted on technical details of operation of GSO] 
	
	
 Notwithstanding the above, in reality only three of the 15 launch pad centres worldwide are located near the Equator - Kourou, San Marco and Sriharikota. But the famous US space centre, the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida is located relatively far from the Equator. Therefore, plans to construct a space port should be moved from Christmas Island if Australia is really willing to listen to Indonesia's objections. 
	
	
 International law governing accountability if one nation's space debris falls on another is already in existence. The main convention is the UN Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, 28 March 1972, known as the 1972 Liability Convention. 
	
	
 The Convention basically sets out the responsibility of the launching state, either jointly or collectively, for the consequences of a launch failure from the time of launching through to the re-entry of a satellite to the Earth's atmosphere. The Convention also sets out various claims that can be made by states who have suffered damages as a result of other states' space projects. 
	
	
 As the nation most likely to suffer the impact of the Australian Space Port, Indonesia could rely on the simplest article in the Liability Convention, Section 14. This section allows states who have suffered damages to claim compensation through the International Claims Commission, which acts as the representative of the appellant state against the launching state (in this case Australia) or any other international organisation which can be classed as a launching state. 
	
	
 Of course, lodging a claim is not as simple as clapping one's hands. Indonesia at the very least needs to sign the UN Convention on Space as well as ratify several other treaties governing national activities in outer space. 
	
	
 These UN Conventions are the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies 1967 (Space Treaty 1967), the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects 1972 (Liability Convention 1972), and finally, the Convention on Registration of Objections launched into Outer Space 1974 (Registration Convention 1974). 
	
	
 So far, the Indonesian Government has only ratified the 1972 Liability Convention. This convention only applies to space objects that fall into Indonesian sovereign territory. Indonesia has only adopted one compensation principle, the Absolute Liability principle. This principle means that the burden of proof that the claimant state has suffered damages does not lie on the state submitting its damages claim. It is sufficient at law to demonstrate the fact of the damage caused as a result of the space object identified as belonging to the launching state or a state that has participated in the space object launching. 
	
	
 A National Space and Flight Agency working paper suggest a high degree of difficulty if Indonesia, as a state that has suffered damage, were to lodge a damages claim. In the case of objections to the Christmas Island space station, Indonesia would need to be able to show that damage that has occurred within its territorial area was caused by space objects launched from the Christmas Island station. This would of course require advanced technology and great cost to bring the matter to a claim submission. 
	
	
 But in conversation with Kompas on Sunday (17 Mar), one of Indonesia's few space law experts, Prof Dr Priyatna Abdurrasyid, expressed a different opinion. Indonesia would not need to produce further evidence to substantiate its claim, he said. It would suffice to submit a claim to the UN Claims Commission and state that the space debris in Indonesia had originated from the Australian space centre. 
	
	
 "If Australia then denies the claim, we need only demand that Australia produce proof that the space debris did not originate from its space centre activities. If a deadlock in negotiations occurs, the parties can ask the UN Claims Commission as a neutral party to act as adjudicator. This is no different to arbitration hearings to resolve other cases," Priyatna said. 
	
	
 Unfortunately, historical precedent shows that claiming compensation is no easy matter. In claiming compensation from the Soviet Union over Cosmos 954, Canada was forced to navigate numerous procedural complications. This is a very important lesson for Indonesia. 
	
	
 Unlike other experts, Priyatna believes that Indonesia should not be too concerned [about the Australian planned space station]. "In principle, my personal opinion is that we shouldn't go against the current. Rather we should the use the current to our mutual benefit," he said. 
	
	
 Meaning that rather than challenging and issuing objections to the Australian space project, Indonesia should take advantage of our southern neighbour's space activities. 
	
	
 "The Space Treaty 1967 obliges launching states to open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states in all its activities. The treaty also pledges that the launching of space objects be purely for humanitarian purposes and not for military purposes," Priyatna said. 
	
	
 The basic principles of the Space Treaty 1967 oblige Australia as the launching state to open the possibility of humanitarian cooperation in the field of space endeavour. "Australia is not allowed to prevent other states who want to cooperate on its space centre. Indonesia can exploit this principle of the Space Treaty 1967. Rather than issuing a letter of objection to the Australian Government, wouldn't it be better to join them in our own national interest?" he asked. 
	
	
 The kangaroo country should implement risk management procedures before opening the space station on Christmas Island, and open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states, and open complete access to cooperation to all states without exception. These principles are upheld in the Space Treaty 1967. 
	
	
 Australia should adhere to the Cardinal Principle of International Law, which states that all nations in the world must first respect and promote the humanitarian interests and progress of all humankind. But the problem is, who can ensure that these guidelines will indeed be adhered to? 
	
	
	


	
If keeping Arafat captive, under siege with the Palestinian people by the Israeli occupying forces, is an affront to Palestinian, Arab dignity, and International justice, it is also a powder keg that will at one point explode, devastating what remains of the Israeli security. It is that same security that Sharon, the assassin, uses as an excuse to instigate struggles and wars, and promote instability. He also pretends that he besieges Arafat because so far, he was unable to confront the Palestinian resistance. 
	
	
 It is only natural, with the guerilla operations successively occur, even inside the fortified settlements, that the world begins to wonder whether the accusations that Arafat was planning, and instructing attacks on Israeli targets despite his captivity, and the round-the-clock Israeli surveillance, were founded. The only interpretation for these accusations is that Arafat has formidable supernatural powers that enable him to defend the rights of his homeland and people against the unlimited capabilities of the Israeli occupying forces equipped with all the mighty US weapon technology. 
	
	
 The failure of the US-made Israeli war machine to settle this unequal battle became clear in the farcical-yet-provocative, statements made by the Israeli minister of defense now present in Washington. He has called for helping aggressive Israel to put a traitorous agent at the head of the Palestinian Authority, who could accept its terms to "assassinate' the rights of Palestinians. 
	
	
 It is certain the Ben Eliezer's hallucination is a mere expression of failure to persuade the world to accept the brutality of the occupying forces' practices. They even embody the bankrupt policy of Israeli criminal extremism and failure to gain legitimacy for its continuing occupation of the Palestinian territories. 
	
	
 Ben Eliezer's raving coincided with the arrival of his assassin boss Sharon to Washington to take part in exerting pressures on the US administration, and persuade it that removing Arafat could bring about the Palestinian surrender, and halt violence as he calls it. Sharon and Ben Eliezer never stopped to consider that no patriotic Palestinian could accept to serve as a substitute agent to Israel. They, along with the extremist gang in the Israeli government, do not want to understand that Arafat symbolizes the Palestinian struggle. With this attitude, Sharon's government showed its true hostility for a leader and chairman elected by his people. US peace Envoy Burns has expressed this after his meeting with president Mubarak. He has declared that US contacts will continue with Arafat considering that he is the elected Palestinian chairman. 
	
	
 I do wish that Burns's statements reflect a true position that signals a return of balance to the US position in dealing with the reality of Palestinian-Israeli struggle. 
	
	
 The time has come, gentlemen, for Sharon, the assassin, to realize that injustice cannot last long. The security of the Israelis depends on the Palestinians' regaining their rights. By besieging Arafat, Sharon has turned him into the "Mandela" of Arab struggle. This foretells that the Israeli occupation's claims will inevitably falls, no matter how long Sharon humiliates Arab dignity, relaying on the protection and support of Washington, which forgot all principles and role in defending justice, and international legitimacy. 
	
	
	


	
OVER 2,374 Bayelsa State people have received free medical services for various ailments, courtesy of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). 
	
	
 A breakdown of the statistics of patients that benefited from the exercise showed that 106 received general surgeries, 20 had eye cataract operations, 260 got eye glasses, while 1, 988 others had general consultations. 
	
	
 Apart from Odi whose people topped the number of beneficiaries (they got 1, 733 out of 2, 374 persons treated), other councils which participated in the free health care are Kolokuma/Opukoma, 284 persons, Kaiama, 213 persons, among others. 
	
	
 Co-ordinator of the project, Mr Sean Nortman, told reporters that 52 volunteers from various fields in medicine help to make the project a reality. 
	
	
 "With the combined goal of providing free quality health care in this rural areas through the dispensing of prescribed drugs as well as undertaking surgeries that came to the medical site daily, we made it to give the patients we come in contact with health advice and education, hopefully to prevent further problems in the future," Nortman said. 
	
	
 In an interview with journalists later, NDDC Executive Director, Finance and Administration, Mr. Timi Alaibe, said that the choice of Odi was a deliberate policy to give the people of the area who are still recovering from the trauma of the 1999 sad incident a sense of belonging. 
	
	
 Alaibe said that the commission was genuinely determined to change the tide of things in Bayelsa and other NDDC states who have been long neglected over years. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, reports of investigation into the recent oil spillage that occurred in Umudike Ohaji Egbema council in Imo State which left eight persons dead and many others injured is ready. 
	
	
 The member representing the Ohaji Egbema Oguta Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives Tony Okere disclosed this on Wednesday while fielding questions from reporters in his constituency office. 
	
	
 He added that the report would be presented before the house as soon as it resumes sitting. 
	
	
 He said the compositions of the committee included representatives from the Directorate of Petroleum Resource of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), government, Shell and the host community to ensure justice and fairness, law to protect only one party" he said. 
	
	
 On the activities of the NDDC, Okere accused the commission of siting projects in non oil producing areas, warning that it might derail from its set objectives.
